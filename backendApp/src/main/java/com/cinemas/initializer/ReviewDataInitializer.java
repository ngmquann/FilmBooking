Ngo Vu Sam brought the Gun-Fu fighting style to conquer Hollywood. The punches and kicks of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan made the whole world crazy. Chau Tinh Tri's unlimited creativity also made many people dance to the dance of the Hammer Head Gang. As for Tony Leung, even just using his seductive eyes is enough to conquer the most demanding \"cinephile\".</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/395c1d8d-605f-4c03-ba76-0265117046e2\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>&nbsp;The trend of swordplay movies with masters and peerless martial arts secret books is the \"spiritual&nbsp;food\" associated with the childhood of many previous generations. Besides the sword-fighting scenes, action films with fierce gunfights and competition between underworld gangs also attract a large number of fans. Those who are&nbsp;passionate about art films cannot ignore each of Wong Kar Wai's picturesque&nbsp;frames. It can be said that the prosperity of Hong Kong that year lasted from the 70s to the early 2000s. It has been a long time since Hong Kong movie fans had the opportunity to be so excited and happy that they burst out when experiencing a movie. a true “made in Hong Kong”&nbsp;work at the cinema. So Cuu Long Citadel: Siege of the Citadel appeared! Adapted from the comic book of the same name by Tu&nbsp;Do Kiem Kieu, the film is set in the 80s when the Kowloon City area was a complicated place full of crime and slums. The head of Thanh Trai in the past was Loi Chan Dong,&nbsp;he borrowed the hand of his subordinate A Chiem to fight the country and became the tycoon here. One day, a man named Long Quyen Phong and his commune&nbsp;brothers arrived at Cuu Long Thanh Trai. Long Quyen Phong and A Chiem fought each other&nbsp;to decide which side Thanh Trai would belong to. As a result, the final winner was Long Quyen Phong. From here, Cuu Long Thanh Trai entered a new era. Many years after the incident of Long Quyen Phong's&nbsp;arrival at Thanh Trai, a young man named Tran Lac Quan crossed the border to Hong Kong and tried to earn money to get an ID card. Mr. Quan was promised by a big boss that as long as he paid enough money, he would complete the procedures to help him have identification documents. Who would have thought that the overbearing old boss would deceive Quan. Unyielding because he was outwitted, Quan took his white goods and fled into&nbsp;the territory of Cuu Long Thanh Trai. In Thanh Trai, Quan had the opportunity to compete with Long Quyen Phong and failed miserably. However, Long Quyen Phong decided to take care of Quan and help him get identification.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/353843e2-ee66-4a90-a7ac-4ef518c766bb\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>During his time&nbsp;in Cuu Long Thanh Trai, Quan met new friends including Tin Nhat, Thap Nhi Young and AV. Long Quyen Phong and his old&nbsp;allies like A Thu and A Ho are all getting older, and they gradually don't want to interfere in the affairs of the wanderers. The milestone of returning Hong Kong to China in 1997 is also approaching, the government is starting to consider planning Kowloon City more carefully. Right at this moment, an incident occurred that caused Tran Lac Quan to be once again pursued. The truth about Quan's background was also revealed, thereby solving the mystery of the great battle at Cuu Long Thanh Trai between the big brothers more than 30 years ago. Director Trinh Bao Thuy and producer Louis Koo showed their determination to \"revive\" the Hong Kong film industry by going all out when restoring the buildings in the Citadel as close to reality as possible. maybe. If filming with real footage is a&nbsp;plus point, limiting CGI is also considered a commendable effort by the filmmaker to&nbsp;bring impressive martial arts sequences. Old Hong Kong material is also recreated in fight&nbsp;scenes between characters. Long Quyen Phong with his profound internal energy deployed right from the beginning of the film has&nbsp;brought a lot of excitement to the audience. The shooting angles when Tran Lac Quan's group&nbsp;confronted the villain were also shown directly, reducing the abuse of cuts or camera shake&nbsp;to cover up the actors' shortcomings in the fighting stage. The next bright spot is the veteran Hong Kong cast: Co Thien Lac, Lam Phong, Hong Kim Bao, Nham Hien Te, Luu Tuan Khiem, Ngu Doan Long... Lam Phong continues to reunite with Co Thien Lac in the new film. . This time he plays the role of Tran Lac Quan, who is helped by Long Quyen Phong (played by Co Thien Lac) to stay in Thanh Trai peacefully. Luu Tuan Khiem also won hearts when his role as Tin Nhat is a person who values \u200B\u200Bgratitude and is completely loyal to Long Quyen Phong.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/a4854265-7019-4671-b788-6fd5b0873c2b\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Veteran star Hong Kim Bao surprised everyone when he still performed well in the duel with Co Thien Lac even though he was over 70 years old and had some difficulty walking. All the essence of classic Hong Kong film flavor&nbsp;is found&nbsp;in Kowloon Citadel: The Siege. The righteous ideals of gangsters are still an exclusive specialty. Not killing senselessly, Hong Kong \"brothers and sisters\" often have the concept of \"when drinking water, remember the source\", \"when there are blessings, enjoy them together, if there are misfortunes, share them together\".This makes the distinction between white and black disappear. Instead&nbsp;there exists a gray area.In the gray area, everyone treats each other with the word \"love\" and values \u200B\u200Beach other with the word \"meaning\". That's why, despite the bloody violence, the \"life and death\" chivalry of the good men in the movie can still bring tears to viewers from the most beautiful aspects of the so-called friendship. .

                            .description("<p>After sweeping many awards from the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Oscar... in 2015, little Riley's interesting emotions returned this summer with the name Emotional Pieces 2. Even with a shadow too big. Much like the first part, the sequel directed by Kelsey Mann still received a storm of praise from both audiences and critics.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/337;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/3f780a7e-259d-4c03-ac43-bf050d18a1ee\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"></figure><p>The story continues about the special emotions inside little girl Riley, but now it is the stage of puberty. Along with emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, the 'control center' also welcomes a series of new emotions including Anxiety, Jealousy, Depression and Shame, which are The factor that made Riley's puberty extremely unstable and somewhat chaotic. To know how the story will unfold, let's go to the cinema to find out. Still maintaining the style of the first part, Inside Out 2 brings an interesting story about the emotions that a young person may encounter during puberty. Before the disturbance in her thoughts appeared, Riley was still guided by Joy, the key emotion of the first part and also her own. But when entering a new environment, with bigger choices, the feeling of anxiety gradually forms and culminates in Anxiety taking over the control center.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/311;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/bd1a38ea-d256-4e85-99d7-f08fbeb01694\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\"></figure><p>In Inside Out, 9-year-old Riley only knows how to laugh when she's happy, when she's sad, she cries. In the end, she understands what it feels like to cry in happiness. But at the present time, the girl has 'sad' categories ranging from anxiety to shame, complicated emotions that partly express the inner feelings of adolescence with a series of events. When directed by Lo An, the orange emotional girl threw away the ego that had long formed the teenager Riley \"I am a good person\", and replaced it with a series of calculations to be able to integrate into the team. Valentina's hockey player - the idol that Riley is fascinated with. That entails a series of thoughtless actions such as hiding one's preferences, eating foods that are difficult to swallow, and especially avoiding and becoming distant from one's own friends. Director Kelsey Mann was very delicate in incorporating a tense opening scene, showing the sensitivity that Riley is facing. Combined with the story at the women's hockey camp, separating Riley from the story with her family in the first part to give her new friends and new problems. Creating a work about teenagers is difficult, a good film also has to be combined with funny emotions, but no story line is inferior or less interesting. Joy's journey to regain control along with little Riley's concerns to get along with her new environment all bring a lot of meaning.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/00e03db4-4ee0-44fd-90d9-38388cac29ed\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Still carrying the spirit of the first part, Inside Out 2 lets Joy find Riley's true self, but this time the mission is mixed with new stops and newly formed areas. First is a prison-like place containing hidden secrets, followed by an abyss of 'naughtiness' where the teenager makes fun of herself, an office where all human resources must draw Possible scenarios for Anxiety, and finally, deep in Riley's mind is a warehouse for Joy to bury the bad memories of the main character girl. Anxiety and Joy's stone-headed intervention greatly influenced Riley's decisions in real life. New emotions such as Anxiety, Shame or Jealousy... are all negative emotions at first glance, however they clearly show Riley's personality as she grows up. Joy always wants Riley to love life, wants Riley to be herself, wants Riley to be a good person, but Anxiety also has her own reasons. Anxiety uses its own way to protect Riley, wanting to turn Riley into the most perfect version. Both Joy and Anxiety are somewhat 'dictatorial' when leading the mind, but then realize that every emotion is worthy of respect and Riley has the right to choose who she is. Considered as leadership emotions, the arguments between Joy and Anxiety are very attractive, both want to bring the best for Riley.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/360;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/79ea1ca5-8bcd-4ce7-a309-4e5f86b54149\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\"></figure><p>The visuals of Inside Out 9 years ago were carefully taken care of by Pixar, and with Inside Out 2, this is made even more impressive. The graphics are still in the old style, but the details are so meticulous that they are vivid, viewers can immerse themselves in the story extremely smoothly. The new film brings laughter to children but also brings many thoughts to adults. Everyone can see a certain side of themselves through the story of little girl Riley, her worries and sometimes self-image still make many adults feel pain. Although there is a relatively lengthy first act reminiscent of the first part, the second act of the work is truly an emotional journey that makes viewers burst into tears. Emotional Puzzles 2 may make viewers at the cinema laugh, but soon their eyes may become wet. The quality of Inside Out 2 is worthy of Pixar filmmakers</p>")

Even though there aren't too many surprises in the story, the filmmakers still know how to take advantage of this strength to create touching works. The new Thai movie Grandma's Wealth will be the next work that will bring many tears from the audience.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/362;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/97ac91ca-b53f-4e65-8f99-bbcc37248a14\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\"></figure><p>The story is about young man M (Putthipong Assaratanakul / Billkin), when he heard that his grandmother had cancer, M decided to return to take care of her. However, his original purpose was not because he wanted to be with her, but because he wanted to inherit the inheritance she left behind. Before time runs out, M must do everything to become her \"darling\". With a relatively predictable plot, the work is still enough to make the entire cinema shed tears. The film has almost no climax to manipulate emotions, nor any fake emotions for viewers to get carried away with. Instead, the true emotions of the entire film circuit are poured into the two central characters. The pace of the film is a bit slow, but it shows the director's sophistication when many small details are installed. Audiences are used to works with dramatic climactic moments, but Grandma's Family takes a different approach and is completely successful.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/5ccfdd54-f5fb-4c9f-8d36-d02a06e3cd4d\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>It will not be difficult for the audience to recognize the transition between M and her grandmother, starting from awkwardness to closeness and warmth. M - who was considered lazy, began to change his attitude after staying at his grandmother's house. Mrs. Amah, initially indifferent because she knew her grandson's intentions, gradually accepted and loved M. Many people will relate to themselves through M's story, or even the story itself. Amah's grandmother's story. When a boy only desires material things and forgets a childhood full of love that his grandmother gave him. M is described somewhat artistically but extremely clearly the current social situation. On the contrary, the grandmother character shows the loneliness of late age. When the children grow up and have their own lives, it is time for people like Mrs. Amah to face everything alone. The most heartbreaking thing is to feel the coldness of the children you once raised. Although it is titled Grandma's Wealth and takes the perspective of boy M, the core of the work is Mrs. Amah's children. Each person has their own suffering and tries to make sense in gaining the right to take care of their mother, or rather, win her affection. Their struggle also partly shows the rivalry, sometimes a bit of favoritism, between siblings in the family. The film also subtly condemns the problem of male superiority, always present somewhere in Asian families.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/1809f077-ddb7-4b3c-a72b-c566ddfce0ba\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>One of the most memorable scenes in the theatrical film is the touching moment when Mrs. Amah confesses to M's mother that although she has two sons, she wants to spend the rest of her days with her daughter. Grandma's profound revelation speaks volumes about the silent expectations often placed on daughters in Asian families. It highlights the cultural nuances in which women, despite their own difficulties, are still considered the primary caregivers. A heavy but very common responsibility that is often imposed by adults themselves. The scene seems simple but is very gentle and extremely touching. The easily visible highlight of the film is the clever integration of humorous elements at the right time, adding depth and appeal to the story. Above all, the interaction between M and his grandmother must be mentioned, which can both create laughter but if you think about it, it can also be the premise for tears. Their sarcastic lines and witty back and forth aren't too profound, but they'll still make your heart flutter, especially when you see the love behind their words.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/7ba7cf01-2071-4ef1-ad93-d13ab2c3998e\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p><br>The design and scenery of the new film bring a very Vietnamese feeling, along with the charm of the voice actors of the dub.</p>")

Besides Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour, National Security, Blue Streak..., Bad Boys can be considered one of the most successful action comedy franchises with the police couple motif.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c8b9ec9f-5742-4292-af96-4fb063a66c30\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Martin Lawrence alone even appeared in 3 movies of the same genre. At the age of nearly 60, both Martin and Will Smith still have an extremely good reunion and are able to \"balance\" the \"bad boy\" gunfights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, Bad Boys directed by Michael Bay officially debuted in theaters and was a huge success with a revenue of more than 140 million dollars compared to a budget of only 19 million dollars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Boys bears the familiar mark of Michael Bay with \"Bay-hem\" camera angles that show the grandeur of continuous explosion scenes. The collaboration between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence helps them become good friends because the juggling of lines is not on the script. Possessing a simple plot, Bad Boys does not challenge viewers with metaphorical details or frames heavy with artistic narrative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything that happens in Bad Boys is for entertainment purposes. From the chase scenes with dozens of bullets fired, to the many funny and ironic situations in Marcus and Mike's personal lives. Obviously, it must include villains who are tough, difficult to deal with, and willing to risk their lives to play \"all in\" with the US security industry. Accompanying that is the \"unlike any other\" friendship between Mike and Marcus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Boys just keeps attracting more and more fans. The adventure of the two \"bad boys\" continues throughout 3 parts. This summer, Bad Boys 4 (Bad Boys: Ride or Die) continues to follow the scouts in their mission to reclaim justice for the late captain Howard.</p><p>After the traumatic event when Armando - Mike's \"reluctant\" son assassinated Howard in Bad Boys For Life. Now the former lady killer always lives in obsession and guilt for not being able to save his respected superior. Marcus himself was also tormented by the sequelae of his underlying illness resulting from his irregular lifestyle.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d1c85a6d-8d35-4e50-9d2c-afbb325f9094\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>At Mike's wedding, Marcus had a cardiac arrest and almost \"went on the road\" with Captain Howard. Having gone through life and death, he suddenly became \"enlightened\" to everything in the world. There was a time when he gave his soulmate - Mike a warning about the storm that was about to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This time the person in trouble was the late Howard. After his death, corrupt officials falsely accused Howard of being affiliated with drug gangs for many years. However, having a premonition of something bad, before he died, Howard left a clue to help Mike and Marcus track down the real mastermind. No longer hunting outlaw groups, Bad Boys: Ride Or Die reverses the roles, making Mike and Marcus on the run for most of the film. The audience also has the opportunity to witness the growth process of the two main characters as they go from charming youth to sick middle age. Mike is no longer a one-hit-wonder marksman, he easily panics and loses his temper. As for Marcus, he had problems with his body's sugar level exceeding the allowable level, and his blood pressure was also worrying. No longer as fierce and agile as when they were young, Mike and Marcus face the harsh truth that they are past their prime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, if fighting is an obstacle, the two old men still have enough strength to use their experience and cunning to shine without fear of being known as \"winning glory\" with the younger generation. Kelly, Dorn or Rita are all quality bad boy partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The new film retains the traditional \"run and shoot\" spirit of Bad Boys. Among the old faces, Reggie - Marcus's son-in-law is the one who impresses the most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/9cd6b005-5060-4c5c-8641-bfd1cdb1c75d\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>In Bad Boys, the two young boys, Reggie, who were only 15 years old at the time, had a rather \"pitiful\" meeting with their father-in-law when they were mercilessly questioned and threatened. Yet the once timid Reggie is now a marine with superior fighting skills. Both Marcus and Uncle Mike were also surprised and somewhat afraid of Reggie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Relaxation and not having to think too much is the message that Bad Boys: Ride Or Die aims to achieve. Throughout the work there are breathtaking chase scenes. Besides, there is a charming sense of humor from the word play of the Mike - Marcus duo. Even the attention-grabbing detail reminiscent of Will Smith's \"shocking\" event at the 2022 Oscars is completely capable of conquering those who are first acquainted with Bad Boys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy Bad Boys: Ride Or Die with IMAX Laser technology at Galaxy Sala, to be immersed in sharp and vivid cinematic moments like never before!</p>")

He said: \"In the movie, bears are evil beasts, but in reality nature is the victim of humans.\"</p><p>The special effects worth watching are the extremely admirable efforts of the film crew. They successfully created a bear that gave the audience a feeling of fear. Honey - the \"great\" mother bear is up to 2 meters tall, accounting for 30% of the total project cost. The crew once made a polar bear model worth 250 million but had to cancel it because it was too fake. Because Mat is an important character and needs to move flexibly throughout many scenes. Director Le Thanh Son decided to abandon the plan to use live-action mascots and switch to using visual effects. Although still limited, it cannot be denied that this investment determination helps the main villain become more vivid.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/251;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d5dc27c6-7fb6-4f30-a357-0258d2146e3a\" width=\"600\" height=\"251\"></figure><p>When mentioning Tuan Tran, people often immediately think of Tran Thanh. The male director who holds the Vietnamese box office revenue record is the one who strongly promotes the name Tuan Tran to the public. From Quan (Godfather), Ut Luc Lam (Southern Forest Land) to Sau (Mai); Every famous role of Tuan Tran is also associated with director/screenwriter Tran Thanh. So what would a non-Tran-Thanh Tuan Tran look like? It can be said that, despite the lack of a tailor, Tuan Tran still fulfilled his assigned role well. He perfectly portrays a young man who is under a lot of \"spinal\" pressure but is still kind and devoted to his friends. Winning impulsiveness, enthusiasm, courage... there are still tender moments that \"capture the hearts\" of the audience next to his lover.</p><p>After the brilliant success of her role as Hong in Mat Biec, \"Hot IELTS girl\" Thao Tam actively acted in films but did not achieve the expected success. Actress Anh Duong's extremely complex inner world in Fanti seemed overwhelming, causing Thao Tam to accept criticism. However, the slightly rebellious Minh in Claw is quite similar to Thao Tam's strong, personality appearance. The young girl who just broke up with her lover is a much \"easier\" role to swallow. Although Thao Tam is a bit tense in some places, Minh is still a character that wins the hearts of viewers.</p><p>Having just participated in the most popular movie in Vietnam in 2024 at this time - Face Off 7: One Wish, Ceri Thu Ha continues to attack the big screen with Claws. As the youngest girl in the group, Mee has a series of humorous lines that ease tension in the film. Quoc Khanh, Naomi, Rocker Nguyen, Gi A Nguyen... each person has their own look but still looks similar, harmonizes and creates impressive highlights.</p><p>Thrilling, dramatic, full of surprises... The Claw is a fascinating survival work, worth enjoying at the cinema. Hopefully, the film will open up new topics, with much more \"land\" to exploit and develop on the big screen, competing with the family-emotional blockbusters that are so familiar in Vietnam.</p>")

It's hard to believe that in the late 70s, when Hollywood was filled with blockbusters of various genres. like horror, space monsters, science fiction... Far away in Australia, there is a director with a unique idea who has created a series of films set in a fascinating post-apocalyptic setting.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c53883a1-791d-4ae6-af67-4f6abdaedf51\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>George Miller couldn't have used his $350,000 budget in the right way to create crazy desert chases. Accompanying that is a set of supercars that have been \"refurbished\" to the point where it couldn't be more bizarre. Combining a punk-rock fashion style, the eccentricity of the Mad Max trilogy (1979 – 1985) reached its peak when a few “box cars”, some of the clothes, reached an influential level of popularity. to popular culture.</p><p>It seemed that the filmmaker from the land of kangaroos had run out of ideas for Mad Max, a happy ending for an already famous and famous brand, but he surprised the world when he released Mad Max. : Fury Road in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic that makes anyone overwhelmed when enjoying it at the cinema.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of the rise of CGI, George Miller made Mad Max: Fury Road in the most manual way possible.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/8d09aae1-b60e-4692-bbd9-035e08ed8289\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many vehicles were requisitioned and redesigned to be \"war chariots\", and the strange props were also real goods \"customized\" specifically for Fury Road. When the \"tools\" are ready, George just needs to shout \"ACTION!\", so a series of scenes of racing, javelin throwing, landmines, explosions..., just happen continuously. The fierceness will continue until he says \"CUT!\". Adding a little spice in post-production, Mad Max: Fury Road was so successful that it was not only considered one of the best action films of the 2010s, but also \"carried\" 6 Oscar gold statues. price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Mel Gibson (who played Mad Max in the first 3 parts) is older, he is comforted by the fact that Tom Hardy has fulfilled the role of his successor well.</p><p>With only 63 lines of dialogue throughout the 120-minute runtime, Tom Hardy with his speaking eyes gave one of the best performances of his career. Accompanying Max is female commander Furiosa, played by star Charlize Theron. Furiosa is a strong, indomitable warrior with a painful past. Charlize Theron acts so well that her role sometimes surpasses that of Tom. As a result, a prequel about Furiosa is also planned to be produced and released in summer 2024.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/25883db0-3aaa-4dc5-a151-47cbffa3d3ef\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga recounts Furiosa's childhood in the Blue Zone until the fateful day she was kidnapped. That was 15 years before the events of Fury Road occurred. The girl Furiosa was unfortunately taken away by Lord Dementus's subordinates. They want to invade the fertile land rich in vitality in the Green Zone. Furiosa's mother tried to save her but failed. The turning point came when Dementus wanted to share the area with Joe Immortal (also the main villain of Mad Max: Fury Road). Joe agreed to negotiate on the condition that Furiosa be handed over to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Living in a citadel under the rule of Joe Immortal, Furiosa gradually becomes a skilled female general mastering skills such as shooting, driving, and close combat. She trained endlessly to wait for the opportunity to find Dementus to take revenge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still retaining the original spirit of the Mad Max series, Furiosa: The Story of Mad Max continues to bring bloody battles in the desert. Chasing scenes between a series of strange \"vehicles\" at high speed can make viewers tense to the point of suffocation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Replacing Charlize Theron to take on the role of young Furiosa in the new film, Anya Taylor-Joy has proven that she is completely capable of becoming the image of a new generation female general through her extremely good acting ability. On the evil side, Chris Hemsworth caused excitement when he first took on the role of a villain with a complex interior. Dementus' ideals and purpose come from suffering and rebirth after painful losses. Dementus represents the worst of a degenerate good person. After Thor, this can be seen as a role that gives Chris a chance to transform and reveal his diverse role-playing talent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because the script was built for the audience to understand more about the character Furiosa, the fights are somewhat reduced compared to Fury Road. Silence focuses on exploring Furiosa's psychology after the events she had to go through. Her tolerance beyond limits sometimes makes her stuck with many thoughts. Childhood, family, joy... everything, when taken away, will make people suffer.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/b11e613c-511c-4fbf-a165-6e4d4a1461ec\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Or that was the beginning of the crazy days but also marked the beginning of the new civilization's plaintive songs filled with happiness.

Young and old, many generations have grown up with Doraemon, which is both humorous and contains many life lessons.</p><p><br>In 2023, Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Sky Utopia / Doraemon: Nobita And The Ideal Land In The Sky set a record - reaching the top 10 highest revenue at the box office in our country. Now, with its 43rd movie, the robot cat continues to be a popular name at both the Japanese and Vietnamese box offices! Right from the early screenings, Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony / Doraemon: Nobita And The Earth Symphony quickly broke many box office records.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>This summer, Nobita's class practiced playing the flute during the end-of-school year celebration. Unfortunately, the boy Nobita \"breathed\" out the note \"No\" and cackled, making his friends laugh forever. Angry at being ridiculed by Gian - Suneo, Nobita begged Doraemon to help him play music well. However, why does that treasure exist?<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/088d4080-d967-4845-ac56-895e3128235b\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Even though he always hated the flute, Nobita still tried to go to the riverbank to practice. Unexpectedly, the sound of that bamboo flute excitedly complimented the little girl Micca with her striking green hair. She also invited Nobita, Doraemon and friends to her Farre palace.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Farre Palace - where music turns into energy - has fallen asleep due to a disaster ten thousand years ago. To save this place, Micca needs to search for the virtuoso - music masters and the Doraemon group is the chosen one. With the treasure \"Music Specialist Certificate\", Doraemon helps his group of friends find the \"fateful\" musical instrument to save the palace. However, they do not know that danger is coming very close. Not only Farre Palace, but also the Earth is in danger, music is in danger of being wiped out...</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d8183c1e-9112-4acb-8edb-a53c550dbcee\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>How do Doraemon and his friends face the prospect of a world without music? How to save humanity?<br><br>Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony is a good movie with a completely new plot, not a remake of the classic work by author Fujiko F. Fujio.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/eabfc1b6-d41a-4fcf-9225-560004070331\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Just as introduced in the poster, the view of Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony is brilliant and colorful. Doraemon movies are increasingly improving in image quality. Film color is bright and clear. Each frame is meticulously cared for. The riverbank where Nobita met Micca is filled with peace. The architecture of Farre Palace is extremely magnificent. It's all enough to make the audience marvel. In addition, your group's outfits are extremely cute and trendy. Especially Suneo. From the clothes to the shoes, everything is impressive, suitable for the boy's fashion knowledge.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d8a2bc26-5f26-41de-858f-044e38acd410\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>The film's pace is fast, with many humorous details but not lacking in emotional moments, bringing tears to the audience's eyes. The movie circuit is still very familiar. Nobita causes some trouble, a special character appears and takes the group on an adventure to save the world. In the end, as always, the shy boy Nobi Nobita holds the final key to solving the problem. Doraemon became the conductor, Shizuka played percussion, Gian used the trumpet, Suneo played the violin and Nobita - unlucky as always, chose the thing he hated the most - the flute. However, this is an extremely important musical instrument in the film. However, avid Doraemon fans will be a bit regretful because Shizuka and Jaian do not have a \"dual sword match\" to defeat all types of weapons - Shizuka plays the violin and Jaian sings. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c5792139-1677-4651-bf04-39750e0dadb0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Several music-related treasures also appeared alongside new \"toys\". This makes the audience both familiar and strange, both reminiscent of childhood memories and a new highlight, making the film more attractive.<br>In particular, Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony has many details paying tribute to the great composer Beethoven.</p><p>Kazuaki Imai once directed Doraemon: Nobita and the Hidden Gold Island (2018), Doraemon: Nobita and His New Dinosaur Friends (2020). He came up with the idea of \u200B\u200Bmaking Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony when he heard his son sing during the blockade due to Covid-19. On the contrary, screenwriter Utsumi Teruko, although a completely new name to Doraemon movie fans, still delivered a work in the spirit of \"father\" Fujiko F. Fujio.</p>")

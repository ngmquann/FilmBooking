Ngo Vu Sam brought the Gun-Fu fighting style to conquer Hollywood. The punches and kicks of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan made the whole world crazy. Chau Tinh Tri's unlimited creativity also made many people dance to the dance of the Hammer Head Gang. As for Tony Leung, even just using his seductive eyes is enough to conquer the most demanding \"cinephile\".</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/395c1d8d-605f-4c03-ba76-0265117046e2\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>&nbsp;The trend of swordplay movies with masters and peerless martial arts secret books is the \"spiritual&nbsp;food\" associated with the childhood of many previous generations. Besides the sword-fighting scenes, action films with fierce gunfights and competition between underworld gangs also attract a large number of fans. Those who are&nbsp;passionate about art films cannot ignore each of Wong Kar Wai's picturesque&nbsp;frames. It can be said that the prosperity of Hong Kong that year lasted from the 70s to the early 2000s. It has been a long time since Hong Kong movie fans had the opportunity to be so excited and happy that they burst out when experiencing a movie. a true “made in Hong Kong”&nbsp;work at the cinema. So Cuu Long Citadel: Siege of the Citadel appeared! Adapted from the comic book of the same name by Tu&nbsp;Do Kiem Kieu, the film is set in the 80s when the Kowloon City area was a complicated place full of crime and slums. The head of Thanh Trai in the past was Loi Chan Dong,&nbsp;he borrowed the hand of his subordinate A Chiem to fight the country and became the tycoon here. One day, a man named Long Quyen Phong and his commune&nbsp;brothers arrived at Cuu Long Thanh Trai. Long Quyen Phong and A Chiem fought each other&nbsp;to decide which side Thanh Trai would belong to. As a result, the final winner was Long Quyen Phong. From here, Cuu Long Thanh Trai entered a new era. Many years after the incident of Long Quyen Phong's&nbsp;arrival at Thanh Trai, a young man named Tran Lac Quan crossed the border to Hong Kong and tried to earn money to get an ID card. Mr. Quan was promised by a big boss that as long as he paid enough money, he would complete the procedures to help him have identification documents. Who would have thought that the overbearing old boss would deceive Quan. Unyielding because he was outwitted, Quan took his white goods and fled into&nbsp;the territory of Cuu Long Thanh Trai. In Thanh Trai, Quan had the opportunity to compete with Long Quyen Phong and failed miserably. However, Long Quyen Phong decided to take care of Quan and help him get identification.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/353843e2-ee66-4a90-a7ac-4ef518c766bb\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>During his time&nbsp;in Cuu Long Thanh Trai, Quan met new friends including Tin Nhat, Thap Nhi Young and AV. Long Quyen Phong and his old&nbsp;allies like A Thu and A Ho are all getting older, and they gradually don't want to interfere in the affairs of the wanderers. The milestone of returning Hong Kong to China in 1997 is also approaching, the government is starting to consider planning Kowloon City more carefully. Right at this moment, an incident occurred that caused Tran Lac Quan to be once again pursued. The truth about Quan's background was also revealed, thereby solving the mystery of the great battle at Cuu Long Thanh Trai between the big brothers more than 30 years ago. Director Trinh Bao Thuy and producer Louis Koo showed their determination to \"revive\" the Hong Kong film industry by going all out when restoring the buildings in the Citadel as close to reality as possible. maybe. If filming with real footage is a&nbsp;plus point, limiting CGI is also considered a commendable effort by the filmmaker to&nbsp;bring impressive martial arts sequences. Old Hong Kong material is also recreated in fight&nbsp;scenes between characters. Long Quyen Phong with his profound internal energy deployed right from the beginning of the film has&nbsp;brought a lot of excitement to the audience. The shooting angles when Tran Lac Quan's group&nbsp;confronted the villain were also shown directly, reducing the abuse of cuts or camera shake&nbsp;to cover up the actors' shortcomings in the fighting stage. The next bright spot is the veteran Hong Kong cast: Co Thien Lac, Lam Phong, Hong Kim Bao, Nham Hien Te, Luu Tuan Khiem, Ngu Doan Long... Lam Phong continues to reunite with Co Thien Lac in the new film. . This time he plays the role of Tran Lac Quan, who is helped by Long Quyen Phong (played by Co Thien Lac) to stay in Thanh Trai peacefully. Luu Tuan Khiem also won hearts when his role as Tin Nhat is a person who values \u200B\u200Bgratitude and is completely loyal to Long Quyen Phong.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/a4854265-7019-4671-b788-6fd5b0873c2b\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Veteran star Hong Kim Bao surprised everyone when he still performed well in the duel with Co Thien Lac even though he was over 70 years old and had some difficulty walking. All the essence of classic Hong Kong film flavor&nbsp;is found&nbsp;in Kowloon Citadel: The Siege. The righteous ideals of gangsters are still an exclusive specialty. Not killing senselessly, Hong Kong \"brothers and sisters\" often have the concept of \"when drinking water, remember the source\", \"when there are blessings, enjoy them together, if there are misfortunes, share them together\".This makes the distinction between white and black disappear. Instead&nbsp;there exists a gray area.In the gray area, everyone treats each other with the word \"love\" and values \u200B\u200Beach other with the word \"meaning\". That's why, despite the bloody violence, the \"life and death\" chivalry of the good men in the movie can still bring tears to viewers from the most beautiful aspects of the so-called friendship. .

                            .description("<p>After sweeping many awards from the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Oscar... in 2015, little Riley's interesting emotions returned this summer with the name Emotional Pieces 2. Even with a shadow too big. Much like the first part, the sequel directed by Kelsey Mann still received a storm of praise from both audiences and critics.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/337;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/3f780a7e-259d-4c03-ac43-bf050d18a1ee\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"></figure><p>The story continues about the special emotions inside little girl Riley, but now it is the stage of puberty. Along with emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, the 'control center' also welcomes a series of new emotions including Anxiety, Jealousy, Depression and Shame, which are The factor that made Riley's puberty extremely unstable and somewhat chaotic. To know how the story will unfold, let's go to the cinema to find out. Still maintaining the style of the first part, Inside Out 2 brings an interesting story about the emotions that a young person may encounter during puberty. Before the disturbance in her thoughts appeared, Riley was still guided by Joy, the key emotion of the first part and also her own. But when entering a new environment, with bigger choices, the feeling of anxiety gradually forms and culminates in Anxiety taking over the control center.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/311;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/bd1a38ea-d256-4e85-99d7-f08fbeb01694\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\"></figure><p>In Inside Out, 9-year-old Riley only knows how to laugh when she's happy, when she's sad, she cries. In the end, she understands what it feels like to cry in happiness. But at the present time, the girl has 'sad' categories ranging from anxiety to shame, complicated emotions that partly express the inner feelings of adolescence with a series of events. When directed by Lo An, the orange emotional girl threw away the ego that had long formed the teenager Riley \"I am a good person\", and replaced it with a series of calculations to be able to integrate into the team. Valentina's hockey player - the idol that Riley is fascinated with. That entails a series of thoughtless actions such as hiding one's preferences, eating foods that are difficult to swallow, and especially avoiding and becoming distant from one's own friends. Director Kelsey Mann was very delicate in incorporating a tense opening scene, showing the sensitivity that Riley is facing. Combined with the story at the women's hockey camp, separating Riley from the story with her family in the first part to give her new friends and new problems. Creating a work about teenagers is difficult, a good film also has to be combined with funny emotions, but no story line is inferior or less interesting. Joy's journey to regain control along with little Riley's concerns to get along with her new environment all bring a lot of meaning.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/00e03db4-4ee0-44fd-90d9-38388cac29ed\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Still carrying the spirit of the first part, Inside Out 2 lets Joy find Riley's true self, but this time the mission is mixed with new stops and newly formed areas. First is a prison-like place containing hidden secrets, followed by an abyss of 'naughtiness' where the teenager makes fun of herself, an office where all human resources must draw Possible scenarios for Anxiety, and finally, deep in Riley's mind is a warehouse for Joy to bury the bad memories of the main character girl. Anxiety and Joy's stone-headed intervention greatly influenced Riley's decisions in real life. New emotions such as Anxiety, Shame or Jealousy... are all negative emotions at first glance, however they clearly show Riley's personality as she grows up. Joy always wants Riley to love life, wants Riley to be herself, wants Riley to be a good person, but Anxiety also has her own reasons. Anxiety uses its own way to protect Riley, wanting to turn Riley into the most perfect version. Both Joy and Anxiety are somewhat 'dictatorial' when leading the mind, but then realize that every emotion is worthy of respect and Riley has the right to choose who she is. Considered as leadership emotions, the arguments between Joy and Anxiety are very attractive, both want to bring the best for Riley.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/360;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/79ea1ca5-8bcd-4ce7-a309-4e5f86b54149\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\"></figure><p>The visuals of Inside Out 9 years ago were carefully taken care of by Pixar, and with Inside Out 2, this is made even more impressive. The graphics are still in the old style, but the details are so meticulous that they are vivid, viewers can immerse themselves in the story extremely smoothly. The new film brings laughter to children but also brings many thoughts to adults. Everyone can see a certain side of themselves through the story of little girl Riley, her worries and sometimes self-image still make many adults feel pain. Although there is a relatively lengthy first act reminiscent of the first part, the second act of the work is truly an emotional journey that makes viewers burst into tears. Emotional Puzzles 2 may make viewers at the cinema laugh, but soon their eyes may become wet. The quality of Inside Out 2 is worthy of Pixar filmmakers</p>")

                            .description("<p>Family love is always a sacred feeling and easily touches the hearts of many people. Even though there aren't too many surprises in the story, the filmmakers still know how to take advantage of this strength to create touching works. The new Thai movie Grandma's Wealth will be the next work that will bring many tears from the audience.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/362;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/97ac91ca-b53f-4e65-8f99-bbcc37248a14\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\"></figure><p>The story is about young man M (Putthipong Assaratanakul / Billkin), when he heard that his grandmother had cancer, M decided to return to take care of her. However, his original purpose was not because he wanted to be with her, but because he wanted to inherit the inheritance she left behind. Before time runs out, M must do everything to become her \"darling\". With a relatively predictable plot, the work is still enough to make the entire cinema shed tears. The film has almost no climax to manipulate emotions, nor any fake emotions for viewers to get carried away with. Instead, the true emotions of the entire film circuit are poured into the two central characters. The pace of the film is a bit slow, but it shows the director's sophistication when many small details are installed. Audiences are used to works with dramatic climactic moments, but Grandma's Family takes a different approach and is completely successful.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/5ccfdd54-f5fb-4c9f-8d36-d02a06e3cd4d\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>It will not be difficult for the audience to recognize the transition between M and her grandmother, starting from awkwardness to closeness and warmth. M - who was considered lazy, began to change his attitude after staying at his grandmother's house. Mrs. Amah, initially indifferent because she knew her grandson's intentions, gradually accepted and loved M. Many people will relate to themselves through M's story, or even the story itself. Amah's grandmother's story. When a boy only desires material things and forgets a childhood full of love that his grandmother gave him. M is described somewhat artistically but extremely clearly the current social situation. On the contrary, the grandmother character shows the loneliness of late age. When the children grow up and have their own lives, it is time for people like Mrs. Amah to face everything alone. The most heartbreaking thing is to feel the coldness of the children you once raised. Although it is titled Grandma's Wealth and takes the perspective of boy M, the core of the work is Mrs. Amah's children. Each person has their own suffering and tries to make sense in gaining the right to take care of their mother, or rather, win her affection. Their struggle also partly shows the rivalry, sometimes a bit of favoritism, between siblings in the family. The film also subtly condemns the problem of male superiority, always present somewhere in Asian families.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/1809f077-ddb7-4b3c-a72b-c566ddfce0ba\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>One of the most memorable scenes in the theatrical film is the touching moment when Mrs. Amah confesses to M's mother that although she has two sons, she wants to spend the rest of her days with her daughter. Grandma's profound revelation speaks volumes about the silent expectations often placed on daughters in Asian families. It highlights the cultural nuances in which women, despite their own difficulties, are still considered the primary caregivers. A heavy but very common responsibility that is often imposed by adults themselves. The scene seems simple but is very gentle and extremely touching. The easily visible highlight of the film is the clever integration of humorous elements at the right time, adding depth and appeal to the story. Above all, the interaction between M and his grandmother must be mentioned, which can both create laughter but if you think about it, it can also be the premise for tears. Their sarcastic lines and witty back and forth aren't too profound, but they'll still make your heart flutter, especially when you see the love behind their words.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/7ba7cf01-2071-4ef1-ad93-d13ab2c3998e\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p><br>The design and scenery of the new film bring a very Vietnamese feeling, along with the charm of the voice actors of the dub.</p>")

Besides Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour, National Security, Blue Streak..., Bad Boys can be considered one of the most successful action comedy franchises with the police couple motif.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c8b9ec9f-5742-4292-af96-4fb063a66c30\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Martin Lawrence alone even appeared in 3 movies of the same genre. At the age of nearly 60, both Martin and Will Smith still have an extremely good reunion and are able to \"balance\" the \"bad boy\" gunfights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, Bad Boys directed by Michael Bay officially debuted in theaters and was a huge success with a revenue of more than 140 million dollars compared to a budget of only 19 million dollars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Boys bears the familiar mark of Michael Bay with \"Bay-hem\" camera angles that show the grandeur of continuous explosion scenes. The collaboration between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence helps them become good friends because the juggling of lines is not on the script. Possessing a simple plot, Bad Boys does not challenge viewers with metaphorical details or frames heavy with artistic narrative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything that happens in Bad Boys is for entertainment purposes. From the chase scenes with dozens of bullets fired, to the many funny and ironic situations in Marcus and Mike's personal lives. Obviously, it must include villains who are tough, difficult to deal with, and willing to risk their lives to play \"all in\" with the US security industry. Accompanying that is the \"unlike any other\" friendship between Mike and Marcus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Boys just keeps attracting more and more fans. The adventure of the two \"bad boys\" continues throughout 3 parts. This summer, Bad Boys 4 (Bad Boys: Ride or Die) continues to follow the scouts in their mission to reclaim justice for the late captain Howard.</p><p>After the traumatic event when Armando - Mike's \"reluctant\" son assassinated Howard in Bad Boys For Life. Now the former lady killer always lives in obsession and guilt for not being able to save his respected superior. Marcus himself was also tormented by the sequelae of his underlying illness resulting from his irregular lifestyle.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d1c85a6d-8d35-4e50-9d2c-afbb325f9094\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>At Mike's wedding, Marcus had a cardiac arrest and almost \"went on the road\" with Captain Howard. Having gone through life and death, he suddenly became \"enlightened\" to everything in the world. There was a time when he gave his soulmate - Mike a warning about the storm that was about to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This time the person in trouble was the late Howard. After his death, corrupt officials falsely accused Howard of being affiliated with drug gangs for many years. However, having a premonition of something bad, before he died, Howard left a clue to help Mike and Marcus track down the real mastermind. No longer hunting outlaw groups, Bad Boys: Ride Or Die reverses the roles, making Mike and Marcus on the run for most of the film. The audience also has the opportunity to witness the growth process of the two main characters as they go from charming youth to sick middle age. Mike is no longer a one-hit-wonder marksman, he easily panics and loses his temper. As for Marcus, he had problems with his body's sugar level exceeding the allowable level, and his blood pressure was also worrying. No longer as fierce and agile as when they were young, Mike and Marcus face the harsh truth that they are past their prime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, if fighting is an obstacle, the two old men still have enough strength to use their experience and cunning to shine without fear of being known as \"winning glory\" with the younger generation. Kelly, Dorn or Rita are all quality bad boy partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The new film retains the traditional \"run and shoot\" spirit of Bad Boys. Among the old faces, Reggie - Marcus's son-in-law is the one who impresses the most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/9cd6b005-5060-4c5c-8641-bfd1cdb1c75d\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>In Bad Boys, the two young boys, Reggie, who were only 15 years old at the time, had a rather \"pitiful\" meeting with their father-in-law when they were mercilessly questioned and threatened. Yet the once timid Reggie is now a marine with superior fighting skills. Both Marcus and Uncle Mike were also surprised and somewhat afraid of Reggie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Relaxation and not having to think too much is the message that Bad Boys: Ride Or Die aims to achieve. Throughout the work there are breathtaking chase scenes. Besides, there is a charming sense of humor from the word play of the Mike - Marcus duo. Even the attention-grabbing detail reminiscent of Will Smith's \"shocking\" event at the 2022 Oscars is completely capable of conquering those who are first acquainted with Bad Boys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy Bad Boys: Ride Or Die with IMAX Laser technology at Galaxy Sala, to be immersed in sharp and vivid cinematic moments like never before!</p>")

He said: \"In the movie, bears are evil beasts, but in reality nature is the victim of humans.\"</p><p>The special effects worth watching are the extremely admirable efforts of the film crew. They successfully created a bear that gave the audience a feeling of fear. Honey - the \"great\" mother bear is up to 2 meters tall, accounting for 30% of the total project cost. The crew once made a polar bear model worth 250 million but had to cancel it because it was too fake. Because Mat is an important character and needs to move flexibly throughout many scenes. Director Le Thanh Son decided to abandon the plan to use live-action mascots and switch to using visual effects. Although still limited, it cannot be denied that this investment determination helps the main villain become more vivid.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/251;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d5dc27c6-7fb6-4f30-a357-0258d2146e3a\" width=\"600\" height=\"251\"></figure><p>When mentioning Tuan Tran, people often immediately think of Tran Thanh. The male director who holds the Vietnamese box office revenue record is the one who strongly promotes the name Tuan Tran to the public. From Quan (Godfather), Ut Luc Lam (Southern Forest Land) to Sau (Mai); Every famous role of Tuan Tran is also associated with director/screenwriter Tran Thanh. So what would a non-Tran-Thanh Tuan Tran look like? It can be said that, despite the lack of a tailor, Tuan Tran still fulfilled his assigned role well. He perfectly portrays a young man who is under a lot of \"spinal\" pressure but is still kind and devoted to his friends. Winning impulsiveness, enthusiasm, courage... there are still tender moments that \"capture the hearts\" of the audience next to his lover.</p><p>After the brilliant success of her role as Hong in Mat Biec, \"Hot IELTS girl\" Thao Tam actively acted in films but did not achieve the expected success. Actress Anh Duong's extremely complex inner world in Fanti seemed overwhelming, causing Thao Tam to accept criticism. However, the slightly rebellious Minh in Claw is quite similar to Thao Tam's strong, personality appearance. The young girl who just broke up with her lover is a much \"easier\" role to swallow. Although Thao Tam is a bit tense in some places, Minh is still a character that wins the hearts of viewers.</p><p>Having just participated in the most popular movie in Vietnam in 2024 at this time - Face Off 7: One Wish, Ceri Thu Ha continues to attack the big screen with Claws. As the youngest girl in the group, Mee has a series of humorous lines that ease tension in the film. Quoc Khanh, Naomi, Rocker Nguyen, Gi A Nguyen... each person has their own look but still looks similar, harmonizes and creates impressive highlights.</p><p>Thrilling, dramatic, full of surprises... The Claw is a fascinating survival work, worth enjoying at the cinema. Hopefully, the film will open up new topics, with much more \"land\" to exploit and develop on the big screen, competing with the family-emotional blockbusters that are so familiar in Vietnam.</p>")

It's hard to believe that in the late 70s, when Hollywood was filled with blockbusters of various genres. like horror, space monsters, science fiction... Far away in Australia, there is a director with a unique idea who has created a series of films set in a fascinating post-apocalyptic setting.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c53883a1-791d-4ae6-af67-4f6abdaedf51\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>George Miller couldn't have used his $350,000 budget in the right way to create crazy desert chases. Accompanying that is a set of supercars that have been \"refurbished\" to the point where it couldn't be more bizarre. Combining a punk-rock fashion style, the eccentricity of the Mad Max trilogy (1979 – 1985) reached its peak when a few “box cars”, some of the clothes, reached an influential level of popularity. to popular culture.</p><p>It seemed that the filmmaker from the land of kangaroos had run out of ideas for Mad Max, a happy ending for an already famous and famous brand, but he surprised the world when he released Mad Max. : Fury Road in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic that makes anyone overwhelmed when enjoying it at the cinema.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of the rise of CGI, George Miller made Mad Max: Fury Road in the most manual way possible.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/8d09aae1-b60e-4692-bbd9-035e08ed8289\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many vehicles were requisitioned and redesigned to be \"war chariots\", and the strange props were also real goods \"customized\" specifically for Fury Road. When the \"tools\" are ready, George just needs to shout \"ACTION!\", so a series of scenes of racing, javelin throwing, landmines, explosions..., just happen continuously. The fierceness will continue until he says \"CUT!\". Adding a little spice in post-production, Mad Max: Fury Road was so successful that it was not only considered one of the best action films of the 2010s, but also \"carried\" 6 Oscar gold statues. price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Mel Gibson (who played Mad Max in the first 3 parts) is older, he is comforted by the fact that Tom Hardy has fulfilled the role of his successor well.</p><p>With only 63 lines of dialogue throughout the 120-minute runtime, Tom Hardy with his speaking eyes gave one of the best performances of his career. Accompanying Max is female commander Furiosa, played by star Charlize Theron. Furiosa is a strong, indomitable warrior with a painful past. Charlize Theron acts so well that her role sometimes surpasses that of Tom. As a result, a prequel about Furiosa is also planned to be produced and released in summer 2024.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/25883db0-3aaa-4dc5-a151-47cbffa3d3ef\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga recounts Furiosa's childhood in the Blue Zone until the fateful day she was kidnapped. That was 15 years before the events of Fury Road occurred. The girl Furiosa was unfortunately taken away by Lord Dementus's subordinates. They want to invade the fertile land rich in vitality in the Green Zone. Furiosa's mother tried to save her but failed. The turning point came when Dementus wanted to share the area with Joe Immortal (also the main villain of Mad Max: Fury Road). Joe agreed to negotiate on the condition that Furiosa be handed over to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Living in a citadel under the rule of Joe Immortal, Furiosa gradually becomes a skilled female general mastering skills such as shooting, driving, and close combat. She trained endlessly to wait for the opportunity to find Dementus to take revenge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still retaining the original spirit of the Mad Max series, Furiosa: The Story of Mad Max continues to bring bloody battles in the desert. Chasing scenes between a series of strange \"vehicles\" at high speed can make viewers tense to the point of suffocation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Replacing Charlize Theron to take on the role of young Furiosa in the new film, Anya Taylor-Joy has proven that she is completely capable of becoming the image of a new generation female general through her extremely good acting ability. On the evil side, Chris Hemsworth caused excitement when he first took on the role of a villain with a complex interior. Dementus' ideals and purpose come from suffering and rebirth after painful losses. Dementus represents the worst of a degenerate good person. After Thor, this can be seen as a role that gives Chris a chance to transform and reveal his diverse role-playing talent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because the script was built for the audience to understand more about the character Furiosa, the fights are somewhat reduced compared to Fury Road. Silence focuses on exploring Furiosa's psychology after the events she had to go through. Her tolerance beyond limits sometimes makes her stuck with many thoughts. Childhood, family, joy... everything, when taken away, will make people suffer.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/b11e613c-511c-4fbf-a165-6e4d4a1461ec\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>Or that was the beginning of the crazy days but also marked the beginning of the new civilization's plaintive songs filled with happiness.

Young and old, many generations have grown up with Doraemon, which is both humorous and contains many life lessons.</p><p><br>In 2023, Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Sky Utopia / Doraemon: Nobita And The Ideal Land In The Sky set a record - reaching the top 10 highest revenue at the box office in our country. Now, with its 43rd movie, the robot cat continues to be a popular name at both the Japanese and Vietnamese box offices! Right from the early screenings, Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony / Doraemon: Nobita And The Earth Symphony quickly broke many box office records.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>This summer, Nobita's class practiced playing the flute during the end-of-school year celebration. Unfortunately, the boy Nobita \"breathed\" out the note \"No\" and cackled, making his friends laugh forever. Angry at being ridiculed by Gian - Suneo, Nobita begged Doraemon to help him play music well. However, why does that treasure exist?<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/088d4080-d967-4845-ac56-895e3128235b\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Even though he always hated the flute, Nobita still tried to go to the riverbank to practice. Unexpectedly, the sound of that bamboo flute excitedly complimented the little girl Micca with her striking green hair. She also invited Nobita, Doraemon and friends to her Farre palace.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Farre Palace - where music turns into energy - has fallen asleep due to a disaster ten thousand years ago. To save this place, Micca needs to search for the virtuoso - music masters and the Doraemon group is the chosen one. With the treasure \"Music Specialist Certificate\", Doraemon helps his group of friends find the \"fateful\" musical instrument to save the palace. However, they do not know that danger is coming very close. Not only Farre Palace, but also the Earth is in danger, music is in danger of being wiped out...</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d8183c1e-9112-4acb-8edb-a53c550dbcee\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>How do Doraemon and his friends face the prospect of a world without music? How to save humanity?<br><br>Doraemon The Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony is a good movie with a completely new plot, not a remake of the classic work by author Fujiko F. Fujio.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/eabfc1b6-d41a-4fcf-9225-560004070331\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Just as introduced in the poster, the view of Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony is brilliant and colorful. Doraemon movies are increasingly improving in image quality. Film color is bright and clear. Each frame is meticulously cared for. The riverbank where Nobita met Micca is filled with peace. The architecture of Farre Palace is extremely magnificent. It's all enough to make the audience marvel. In addition, your group's outfits are extremely cute and trendy. Especially Suneo. From the clothes to the shoes, everything is impressive, suitable for the boy's fashion knowledge.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d8a2bc26-5f26-41de-858f-044e38acd410\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>The film's pace is fast, with many humorous details but not lacking in emotional moments, bringing tears to the audience's eyes. The movie circuit is still very familiar. Nobita causes some trouble, a special character appears and takes the group on an adventure to save the world. In the end, as always, the shy boy Nobi Nobita holds the final key to solving the problem. Doraemon became the conductor, Shizuka played percussion, Gian used the trumpet, Suneo played the violin and Nobita - unlucky as always, chose the thing he hated the most - the flute. However, this is an extremely important musical instrument in the film. However, avid Doraemon fans will be a bit regretful because Shizuka and Jaian do not have a \"dual sword match\" to defeat all types of weapons - Shizuka plays the violin and Jaian sings. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/c5792139-1677-4651-bf04-39750e0dadb0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Several music-related treasures also appeared alongside new \"toys\". This makes the audience both familiar and strange, both reminiscent of childhood memories and a new highlight, making the film more attractive.<br>In particular, Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony has many details paying tribute to the great composer Beethoven.</p><p>Kazuaki Imai once directed Doraemon: Nobita and the Hidden Gold Island (2018), Doraemon: Nobita and His New Dinosaur Friends (2020). He came up with the idea of \u200B\u200Bmaking Doraemon: Nobita and the Earth Symphony when he heard his son sing during the blockade due to Covid-19. On the contrary, screenwriter Utsumi Teruko, although a completely new name to Doraemon movie fans, still delivered a work in the spirit of \"father\" Fujiko F. Fujio.</p>")

                            .description("<p>Released last year, Fifty Shades Of Gray became one of the most profitable blockbusters of the year. The film is compared to the old billion-dollar movie franchise - Twilght with many obvious similarities. It's also a romantic but no less wild love story of a pretty girl who doesn't know she's pretty and a handsome rich guy who has an unspeakable secret. Both films had high revenues but seriously lost points in the eyes of critics.</p><p>The biggest question now is what Fifty Shades will do to maintain its box office record and avoid the mistakes that Twilight encountered.</p><p>First of all, let's go back to part 1, when the romance begins. Fifty Shades Of Gray opens with the meeting between Cinderella Anastasia Steele and billionaire Christian Gray. The billionaire was quickly captivated by Ana's beauty, and this romantic English Literature major was also conquered by his sweet actions. The two quickly exchanged passionate glances, their love was as deep as the outside. However, getting together is not easy.</p><p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, Christian revealed Ana a shocking secret about her sexual preferences - BDSM. To become his lover, Ana had to sign a contract with dozens of pages of lists of sexual demands. In return, she will be the billionaire's only lover.</p><p>Pure, innocent and in love with Christian Gray, the girl Anastasia can accept unusual love scenes, endure a lover who does not want to watch movies, have dinner, or sleep with her every night. . all the tolerance a girl can do for her first deep love. However, when she experienced for herself the punishments she would have to endure if she displeased her lover, Ana exploded.</p><p>How can a girl accept the person she loves using hurting her to gain satisfaction? Ana returned all the gifts, refused the huge contract and left the billionaire she loved so dearly.</p><p>Now, in Fifty Shades Darker, the billionaire will have to suppress his ego to regain Cinderella's love.</p><p>Compared to the gentle part 1 that was criticized for being too gentle by female director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel<strong>, Fifty Shades Darker</strong> will be much darker and bolder under the hands of director James Foley, who is \"specialist\". Thriller-themed movies.</p><p>It can be said that the character Anastasia is a life-changing role for actress Dakota Johnson. Participating in many famous movies such as The Social Network, 21 Jump Street, but Dakota was just a faint name in the picture until she became Ana of Fifty Shades of Gray. Her beautiful face and perfect body make the audience unable to take their eyes off the screen. However, Dakota's acting was criticized in the film. Regaining some of her reputation through her natural acting in How To Be Single, this actress with a face very similar to a young Meryl Streep will probably try her best in the new film to prove her ability and avoid the scandal. ruining his reputation despite appearing in a popular movie franchise like the mistake of his colleague Kristen Stewart.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:749/421;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/9d3e96fc-7dbe-40d3-9b6f-172a58ec40fc\" width=\"749\" height=\"421\"></figure><p>Through the trailers revealed by the producers, it can be seen that Anastasia is much more confident than in part 1. Ana is increasingly beautiful and attractive with trendy clothing and sharp makeup. She also made more demands on her billionaire boyfriend, not simply being on the passive side like the previous part. However, the ghosts of the past have not yet let go of Ana. The middle-aged woman who led Christian down a strange sexual path reappears and threatens her fragile happiness. Girls always think that they can change the person they love. However, who can really do that? Is Ana the right person for Christian?</p><p>On the other side, the billionaire also has many concerns. Trying to suppress his strange sexual lifestyle in exchange for the return of the girl he loves, the devil in Christian Gray's heart is always waiting to rise. Can the power of love help him?</p><p>Like Dakota Johnson, before Fifty Shades Of Gray, Jamie Dornan was an almost unknown actor. He is known mainly for his leading role in the television series The Fall with X-Files female star Gillian Anderson. As a former model for the Calvin Klein brand, Jamie has a solid masculine face like a statue, a height of 1m80 and a body that many guys desire. Like Dakota, Jamie's performance in Fifty Shades Of Gray was criticized by audiences and critics in all kinds of ways.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:300/168;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/b2599b6c-7a9d-441e-b1ef-45b24d420f2f\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"></figure><p>This time, in addition to the change of director and screenwriter, the Fifty Shades Darker film crew also had a big change compared to the previous part. If you feel that although Fifty Shades Of Gray's scenes are carefully taken care of, there are still some unsophisticated frames, this time the audience can rest assured that the producer has chosen to film The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man. Jurassic World - John Schwartzman replaced. He is expected to bring the most beautiful and daring frames to the screen. The film was edited by Richard Francis-Bruce - an editor who received 3 Oscar nominations, whose achievements include famous films such as The Shawshank Redemption, Se7en, The Green Mile and Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone...</p><p>Although Fifty Shades Darker has not yet hit theaters, the third Fifty Shades Freed part is planned for production, which confirms the producer's confidence in the new film. Hopefully with the change of production crew, the Fifty Shades brand will dispel critics' doubts, continue to achieve success at the box office and Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan will not have to go down the same path. The fall of two names that once stirred up the world: Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.</p>")

                            .description("<p>Actually, the answer was already answered in Godzilla vs. Kong (2021). The two super beasts are considered the most famous Titans of the Monster Movie Universe - MonsterVerse, who belong to the righteous side that protects the Earth. Of course, no matter how big and strong Kong is, it is difficult to compare with the majestic Godzilla.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/19fc11ba-766b-4cd9-9edf-5c786b8939b0\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>After the \"earth-shattering\" battle from the Hollow Earth to the surface, it seems that both Titans need a long break to recover their physical strength. After taking a break from life, at the end of March this year, fans will have the opportunity to reunite Godzilla and King Kong in the new movie Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.</p><p>In the latest trailer of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire that Warner Bros. released, it seems like this time the Monkey King and the King of Monsters will team up to take care of some bad guys.</p><p>At the beginning of the trailer, little girl Jia of the Iwi tribe seems to sense that something terrible is about to happen. In particular, in the fleeting \"future touch\" segment, Mothra's image is reflected in her eyes. Will Mothra return and continue to side with Godzilla?</p><p>Through the trailer, the villain was also revealed to be Skar King - a giant monkey with red fur and fierce eyes. It seems that Kong has made the trip to the Hollow Earth again and encountered the Skar King.</p><p>As for Godzilla, the King of the Monsters in this movie has awakened from hibernation covered with a pink ice-shaped material. Notably, it seems that that mysterious, colorful thing has empowered Godzilla, causing the light of God's whole body to turn pink, and the sharp spikes on his back to become longer and larger. However, in another scene, Godzilla has a whole-body appearance emitting blue light, almost similar to the peak of his absorption of nuclear energy in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/cdec838a-328e-4775-8da1-f39c5a913352\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>With Godzilla being \"upgraded\" like that, there's no way King Kong will stay still. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has equipped King Kong with a new toy that looks very cool. Instead of using the \"weapon\" ax that Kong's ancestors left behind on the Hollow Earth, the Monkey King will wear an armored glove with the tentative name B.E.A.S.T. Kong's \"hot product\" will likely help promote the potential of thunder to create powerful punches. Movie King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) once had the detail of Kong being struck by lightning and then \"awakening\" and overwhelmingly counterattacking Godzilla.</p><p>Not only Jia, but also Godzilla and Kong had a premonition that some danger was about to appear, specifically here, Skar King.</p><p>On Hollow Earth, Skar King acts as the lord of all creatures living there. In addition, perhaps Skar King has long wanted to declare war on humanity. In launching this \"war\", the first thing to overcome is to defeat King Kong.</p><p>Skar King is known to be a very strong Titan. Even when attacked by both Godzilla and Kong, this ferocious beast still controls the situation. Skar King also has his own \"tool\" used for fighting, which is a bone whip that is effective in long-range combat. It's clear that King Kong must have had a hard time encountering such a \"bloody\" fellow.</p><p>An interesting surprise is that Godzilla x Kong: The Empire will have the presence of a baby monkey who looks like King Kong and has 2 bad Titans. Demonstrating this, audiences watching the trailer witnessed King Kong's terrified expression when he saw something hidden behind the lava layer.</p><p>Many rumors say it is Shimo. A species described as the legendary, unstoppable Frost Titan - with the power to end the world.</p><p>There is not much information about Shimo. Just know that this is one of the first Titans in history that has been rampaging since ancient times. Shimo is speculated to be the cause of Earth's oldest Ice Age.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1135/660;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/3d84a7bc-6866-4e07-be69-d7e132299597\" width=\"1135\" height=\"660\"></figure><p>The trailer for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire doesn't reveal much about Shimo's appearance, but still shows the ice light attack, making it difficult for King Kong to defend. In some respects, if Shimo really appeared in the movie, the duo Skar King - Shimo would have created the opposite of Godzilla - King Kong. The good side is responsible for preserving and conserving the ecosystem, while the evil side wants to dominate and cause climate change to sow death.</p><p>Shimo was actually mentioned for the first time on a cave painting in the game Call Of Duty 2022 (the Monarch campaign event was mentioned in COD combining Godzilla vs. Kong). Besides, many opinions believe that Shimo himself fought with King Ghidorah in the past and \"sealed\" it under eternal ice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>")

                            .description("<p>Nearly 10 years have passed since Mad Max: Fury Road debuted in theaters and created a global sales fever. It's been a long time since George Miller has delivered such a perfect cinematic \"feast\" for the eyes.</p><p>Considered the best part of the Mad Max franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road won the Oscar with 6 convincing gold statues. The post-apocalyptic world in the 2015 re-release is filled with madness. It is that intense and unstable rhythm that makes everyone drawn into the story right from the first minutes.</p><p>Without the handsome and willing Mel Gibson, George Miller still has a wild and masculine Tom Hardy. This time, Max Rockatansky's situation is still suffering from the loss of loved ones, and surviving on the harsh, desolate earth has made him a tough and resilient warrior. However, Max is not alone, because Furiosa accompanies him.</p><p>To be more specific, not only Furiosa but also the strange Nux and the \"weaker army\" take on the role of birth machines. They are likened to \"child-making machines\" because those women are under the control of dictator Joe Immortal. That weird Joe took advantage of the weakness of the human remnants, using his strength and army to hold the most valuable resource of the moment: fresh water!</p><p>He sees himself as the Messiah, giving water so that humans can listen and obey him. Because of that cruelty, Marshal Furiosa made an escape in the hope of finding a way back to the peaceful Green Zone. Max Rockatansky, from his position as a \"blood bag\" for Joe Immortal's henchmen, also tried to escape in search of salvation.</p><p>Max and Furiosa's journey is highlighted by fierce battles in the desert. Of course, George Miller had to make the most of what was available in a \"manual\" way, only to help Mad Max: Fury Road be on par with other classic titles.</p><p>All vehicles, weapons, and items in Mad Max are 100% genuine. The majestic desert space combined with wide angles did not waste a second of the viewer's time as action followed action. The film's rhythm is so firm that it does not create a feeling of suffocation but is still balanced thanks to the well-arranged \"breaks\". This facilitates deep exploration into the character's psychology, building empathy so that those who first meet Mad Max still understand his motivations and goals.</p><p>The \"under-cranking\" technique applied in some chase sequences in the film also helps increase visual effects and bring more dramatic tension.</p><p>*Under-Cranking” is a term in cinematography. By recording at a higher number of frames per second than the original standard (usually 24 frames per second, also known as 24fps). When played at standard speed, the image will move faster than in reality.</p><p>This summer, the story about Mad Max was mentioned again when Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga hit the box office. The new film is considered a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road, focusing on Furiosa's childhood.</p><p>Through the trailer, the audience gets to see the Green Zone - Furiosa's hometown when she was a child. An incident occurred, Furiosa was kidnapped and encountered Lord Dementus. From here, female general Furiosa's adventure away from home for more than 7,000 days officially began.</p><p>The enchanting \"feminist\" image portrayed by star Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road left an unforgettable impression. Sometimes her acting even surpasses Tom Hardy's. Incarnating the young Furiosa is actress Anya Taylor-Joy. She is known for The Witch, The Menu and the series The Queen's Gambit. Because she wanted to play her role more fully, Anya once expressed her desire to \"shave her head\" to look like Charlize Theron in Fury Road. George Miller refused because Furiosa would appear with long hair most of the time in the movie, so CGI technology was used to \"push the clippers\" on her hair. Besides, Furiosa only has 30 lines of dialogue throughout the more than two hours of the work. Actor Tom Hardy also only \"spoke\" 63 times in Mad Max: Fury Road.</p><p>“God of Thunder” Chris Hemsworth was cast as the villain Dementus. This is an interesting experience for the male actor. No longer a one-color superhero, Dementus's madness and chaos made Chris think that was the most attractive and interesting thing about testing for a new role.</p><p>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga continues to be directed by George Miller. At the age of nearly 80, he is still devoted to his passion and dedication to ensure the production of the most meticulous footage. In addition, a 15-minute explosive fight scene that took more than 78 days of filming and the participation of 200 stuntmen promises to be extremely crazy and overwhelm anyone who witnesses it.</p><p>To enjoy the giant-scale setting and absolutely vivid sound of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the IMAX Laser format at Galaxy Sala will be the best choice for \"cinephiles\".</p>")

Due to the side effects being assessed as being out of control, ALZ-112 had to be temporarily suspended.

As a member of the Bene Gesserit order, she is proficient in many skills, especially the use of her voice, which allows her to control the actions of others. Stilgar (the leader of the group of Fremen that Paul meets) convinces Lady Jessica to take on the role of Reverend Mother. To do so, she will have to drink the Water of Life. However, Jessica did not know that she was pregnant with Duke Leto's unborn daughter (in Dune, details of the pregnancy were revealed through dreams and dialogue with Paul). Water of Life gives Jessica all the wisdom and abilities of Reverend Mother, while also passing on all the same abilities to the child in Jessica's womb - Alia. Jessica's position as a Reverend Mother also reinforces Paul's position as the Fremen's messiah.</p><p><strong>Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin)</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/ab38b00b-21b9-47e0-9b15-3a72ac8aab1d\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>After the bloody purge of the Harkonnen family on the Atreides, Gurney Halleck was lucky to survive.

When the movie came out, he was even older than Jon Voight - who played boss Jim Phelps in Mission Impossible (1996).<br>Making his first appearance on the big screen with a small role in Endless Love with Brooke Shields, in just 5 years, Tom Cruise became the top box office star of the 1980s thanks to his handsome face, good acting and strength. Unbelievable suction. He owns a series of lifetime works such as Top Gun (1986), The Color Of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Born On The Fourth Of July (1989). Entering the 90s, the American actor continued to make his mark with Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994), Jerry Maguire (1996) and Mission: Impossible!<br>Even though he is a bright star with a series of popular movies, Tom Cruise's path is not always smooth. There was a time when he was \"disgraced\" to the end of his life. Mission: Impossible III cost $150 million in investment but only grossed nearly $400 million, down significantly from the previous two parts. However, Tom Cruise still persistently believes in the charm of Ethan Hunt.<br>And he turned the \"impossible\" into reality!<br>Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol brought the brand to a strong revival. The film scored 73 points on Metacritic, earning nearly $695 million. The scene where Tom Cruise climbs the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai became one of the most shocking scenes in action movie history!<br>If you learn a little about his personal life, the public has 1001 reasons to hate Tom Cruise. How can viewers ignore the fact that Tom neglected his daughter Suri for so many years or that he joined a notorious cult. Tom's acting achievements are recognized by awards. After entering the list of Best Supporting Actor with Magnolia, for more than two decades, Tom has not received any further nominations from the Academy.<br>However, when it comes to contributions to cinema, Tom Cruise is always at the top!<br>If the filmmaking world has Christopher Nolan who refused to use CGI, then the actor world also has Tom Cruise who said no to body doubles and did not like special effects. He is enthusiastic and hard-working, not afraid of the wounds piling up on the million-dollar actor's body, bringing the most realistic footage!<br>Last year, when the whole world was skeptical about the return of the Top Gun brand after more than 30 years with a huge budget of $177 million, Tom Cruise himself piloted a jet plane and performed extremely dangerous scenes. In the end, Top Gun: Maverick won $1.496 billion.<br>With a lead actor and producer with such a heart and vision, Mission Impossible Karma Part One will definitely be a quality work!<br>Even though the trailer has been released for more than two minutes, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One has not revealed much about the plot of the new film. The public only knows that, as always, Ethan and his teammates had to engage in an unequal battle to defeat a powerful force that surpassed them in every aspect. This time the enemy seems to be an old acquaintance and is threatening his friends' lives.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/265;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/7f38f37d-edb3-455a-aba4-aed3ac110de9\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\"></figure><p>The important characters who have been associated with Mission: Impossible for many years will all return. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg) and especially Ethan's soulmate - Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The villain role in this part is assigned to Esai Morales. Pom Klementieff – Guardians Of The Galaxy's Mantis appears in a confrontation position with Ethan Hunt. Another acquaintance from the Marvel cinematic universe - \"Agent Carter\" Hayley Atwell also participates, but her role has not been revealed much. What's interesting is that during the filming of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, Tom and Hayley had a period of love. However, the couple broke up peacefully and still comfortably promote the movie together.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/39e33e40-4c08-4aff-8666-9b56e6f12cb2\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Filming began a long time ago, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Karma Impossible Mission Part One encountered many difficulties on the way to cinemas. The investment capital is more than $290 million, the biggest in the whole brand. Hopefully, under the direction of Tom Cruise, the new billion-dollar movie about the IMF agent will achieve commensurate success.</p>")

Phase 4 does not set unprecedented records like phase 3, the characters are increasing, the multiverse makes everything more confusing... However, to comment that the MCU is no longer hot at this time is too early. At least, we have to wait for Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania to hit theaters!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/df36cb35-9868-411b-bd46-3fc3485786f2\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Ant-Man is a very special character. He is not as famous as Iron Man, Captain America or Thor. Scott Lang can't even remember his name but is mistakenly called \"Spider-Man\". However, Scott played an important role in helping Captain America and Winter Soldier escape from Iron Man's side in the Civil War battle. Scott is also an indispensable person who helps the Avengers bring back those who have been \"discolored\". Well, an excellent employee certificate from Baskin-Robbins is not worthy of Mr. Kien's many achievements in helping the world.<br>So does Paul Rudd. He is a veteran star of the Marvel cinematic universe, participating for nearly ten years, and is about to have his third solo film. In comparison, the character does not bring him as much glory as Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth. Rudd is very ordinary, not rushing to accept many blockbuster films. This star who is 50 years old but looks like she's only 30 doesn't care too much about fame.<br>However, now, both Scott Lang and Paul Rudd face greater responsibility than ever. Rudd must revive the MCU, which is in a transition period, and Scott Lang must confront an enemy thousands of times more powerful than him - Kang.<br>If the Marvel trailer doesn't deceive us too much, we can imagine Mr. Kien's process of meeting the main villain in both phases 3 &amp; 4 as follows: Because his stepdaughter Cassie accidentally \"reported\", the whole family of her stepmother Hope Van Dyne and her father and daughter entered the quantum world full of dangers. As someone who has lived here for many years, Janet has secrets so dark that she has never told Hope. Most likely, that secret is related to Kang The Conqueror - the villain introduced as more terrifying than Thanos. It's unknown what direction the film will develop, but one thing is certain - Scott Lang will be miserably beaten by Kang!</p><p>In addition, no matter how the movie ends, Kang will still reappear in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. And Ant-Man is present at this event? No one can be sure!<br>Possessing a charming comedic performance and an ageless face, Paul Rudd is the main factor behind the success of Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man And The Wasp (2018). Rudd flawlessly portrays the gentle, friendly and easily bullied Scott Lang. However, when needed, Rudd's Scott Lang still deserves to be one of the Avengers' biggest brains.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:950/471;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/a163d3f9-df41-4b29-afa7-b122024d3b76\" width=\"950\" height=\"471\"></figure><p>Kathryn Newton is the new face taking on Cassie Lang instead of Emma Fuhrmann in Avengers: Endgame. The little girl has grown up and become a powerful assistant to her father and stepmother. It cannot be ruled out that Ant-Man And the Wasp: Quantumania is the part of the movie where Cassie takes the \"spotlight\". Marvel will apply the tactic of using old Avenger to promote new Avenger like Black Widow introduces Yelena and the Hawkeye series introduces Kate Bishop. Possessing a height of 1m65, shiny blonde hair and lovely beauty, Cassie will pave the way for Kathryn Newton's career to grow.</p><p>Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas continue to appear. The new film adds veteran star Bill Murray to the talented cast. In addition, charming secret agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) also participates.<br>Peyton Reed – director of Ant-Man and Ant-Man And The Wasp continues to helm the new part. The combination of this filmmaker who understands Ant-Man so well and new screenwriter Jeff Loveness will certainly bring a lot of fresh life to the series.<br>The soundtrack was responsible for Christophe Beck. This producer has been successful in many projects in collaboration with Disney and Marvel. These include Ant-Man, Ant-Man And The Wasp, Frozen, WandaVision...</p><p>In addition, hopefully Marvel Studios handles the special effects of Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania well. Set in an extremely complex quantum world, it would be a shame if CGI Ant-Man 3 had problems similar to Thor: Love And Thunder. Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever did not meet expectations at the global box office. Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange Into The Multiverse Of Madness still have too many controversial elements, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a very important work for both Marvel Studio and the audience. The company needs an excellent Ant-Man 3 to blow away criticism, the audience needs a great movie to regain faith in the MCU! The law of nature is that where there is up there will be down. MCU has been very successful in phase 3 with huge revenue and outstanding popularity. Therefore, it is not surprising that phase 4 makes many people feel disappointed. However, with so much to exploit in the multiverse, it is believed that Marvel Studio still has many cards to retain the audience.</p>")

The film also received 3 Oscars as well as the honor of being on the Oscar 2019 Best Picture nomination list.<br>There is a precedent for a star leaving while a franchise is ongoing. The public has not forgotten the talented Paul Walker of Fast &amp; Furious. The Fast and the Furious series rationalized that departure by using CGI to add a few scenes and then let Brian O'Conner retire early with his wife and children. However, in the case of Chadwick Boseman and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, things are more complicated. At the end of part 1, the land of Wakanda begins to open up. Many challenges and dangers await the mighty land. King T'challa can hardly \"retire\".<br>The public imagines hundreds of theories to legitimize Chadwick Boseman's departure. There's Shuri becoming Black Panther, there's recasting another actor to play T'Challa, there's CGI face transplant, there's resurrecting Killmonger...<br>Through the first teaser, Marvel once again confirmed someone else to replace Chadwick Boseman. T'Challa died and the people of Wakanda mourned for him. The image of the great king painted on the wall is more moving than the sight of Spider-Man sitting in front of Iron Man's portrait. Because, not only remembering T'Challa, Marvel is honoring Chadwick. It is unclear why the great king died. Most likely, he died in the battle with Namor in Atlantis.<br>Did the people of Atlantis use water to submerge Wakanda? Or what strategy did this mysterious tribe use to cause the country with the top defense system to collapse? Certainly, that battle left behind countless pain, because Queen Ramonda exclaimed indignantly: \"I am the queen of the most powerful country in the world. And my whole family is gone.”</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/357;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/67bafe76-4156-4a44-97d5-e13128fb3618\" width=\"600\" height=\"357\"></figure><p>Through that detail, many people believe that Shuri - the lovely, intelligent princess will hardly survive. This is a bold hypothesis but much more reasonable than Shuri becoming the new Black Panther. Although the talented princess is still not strong enough to inherit the superhero burden associated with T'Challa. Letitia Wright was also caught up in the anti-vaccine controversy, which has been extremely sensitive in recent years - when the Covid-19 pandemic raged across the globe. Meanwhile, Marvel Studios under Disney - a studio that always upholds the ethics of actors - is ready to fire Johnny Depp because Amber Heard falsely accused him of beating his wife.<br>Everything is similar with Winston Duke as M'Baku. However, the return of Oscar-winning star Lupita Nyong'o opens up a new theory. It's not M'Baku, it's not Shuri, there's no need to drag Killmonger back from the grave, the successor to Black Panther might be in Nakia's stomach. The teaser reveals a water birth scene that more or less reinforces this inference.<br>Up to now, this is the most reasonable hypothesis. In addition to Chadwick Boseman, it is easy to recognize that W'Kabi - T'Challa's close friend and General Okoye's husband - is also missing. Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts, Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya had to part ways with his role. The good news is that Everest Ross (Morgan Freeman) returns with Nakia to protect Wakanda. Meanwhile, whether Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) will be revived or not is still up in the air.</p><p>The overall teaser for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is tinged with sadness. Important women to T'Challa: Nakia, Queen Ramonda, Princess Shuri or General Okoye all brace themselves to face danger. A rare happy detail is when Shuri meets Riri Williams/Ironheart at the laboratory.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/62c108cc-cb03-4351-b236-5f8a26b1aa72\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>At the end of the teaser trailer, a new Black Panther turns on battle-ready mode. Who is that? Believe that Marvel is determined to hide the big secret until the last minute and will only let us know when the new movie is released on November 10, 2022.<br>Company president Kevin Feige once revealed: \"It's sad without Chad. However, everyone is extremely excited to bring Wakanda to the big screen again. We will do it in a way that makes Chad proud.” Angela Bassett emphasized that things had to change a lot, but the writers found a way. This time, director Ryan Coogler continues to be responsible for both director and screenwriter. \"I know, Chad doesn't want us to give up,\" Coogler said emotionally about Chadwick Boseman.<br>In addition to the details related to T'Challa, music is the most eye-catching element in the first teaser. The melodies No Woman No Cry cover from Bob Marley's music sounded melodious and tragic, as if bringing the audience along to attend a giant funeral to see off T'Challa.</p><p>After the climax of the battle to defeat Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, the Marvel cinematic universe has many mixed opinions. Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings, Eternals or even Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness... all met with criticism. Thor: Ragnarok was ridiculed for being too funny, even Spider-Man: No Way Home was met with comments criticizing excessive fan service.<br>As the film ending Phase 4, Wakanda Forever bears the heavy responsibility of restoring fans' faith in the MCU. The story is top-notch, the actors are suitable for their roles, the timing is right... It's all there. Let's wait and see how Marvel will do!</p>")

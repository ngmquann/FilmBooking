Although Venom is satisfied that Eddie \"takes him to all the best places\" and Eddie \"needs time to rest\", the two are still a happy couple. However, letting Venom \"eat\" and drink freely caused Eddie to suffer consequences. The government found out, the army went in pursuit, and the duo became fugitives and were hunted everywhere.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/da990d1a-d4cf-433a-98e1-aefb307458df\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>However, that is not the worst thing! The Symbiote race discovers Earth and prepares for an all-out invasion!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Venom's hometown is called Klyntar, built by the evil god Knull with a plot to destroy the entire universe. He is also the owner of the god-killing sword Necrosword that appeared in Thor: Love And Thunder (2022). Many rumors say that Knull is the villain of the new movie Venom: The Last Dance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Patrick Mulligan (Stephen Graham) becomes Toxin's host after the events of Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021). In theory, Toxin is Carnage and Venom. He possesses even greater power than both of them. This could be the secret weapon that helps Venom confront his home planet to protect humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, a series of allusive lines such as: \"If Venom is still alive, it will all be over!\", \"Maybe I won't come out alive, man.\", \"Eddie, the time has arrived!”… Will death separate the Symbrock duo? Kelly Marcel is the director and writer of Venom: The Last Dance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She is the screenwriter of Venom: Let There Be Carnage. This is her first film as director.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Marcel's co-writer in Venom: The Last Dance is male lead Tom Hardy. He also participated in writing the script Let There Be Carnage. Although the first trailer was more than 3 minutes long, it was mainly Tom Hardy talking to Tom Hardy and Eddie Brock interacting with Venom. Viewers do not know who the characters played by Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor are or what role they actually play.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/375;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/54778f97-b57a-438e-8218-c59a1ab14d5e\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\"></figure><p>In particular, Chiwetel Ejiofor played the role of Mordo in Doctor Strange (2016) and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022). Mordo is a magician who has turned to darkness, the archenemy of Stephen Strange. After all, Chiwetel Ejiofor is playing two characters or what does Mordo in the MCU and the mysterious character in Venom: The Last Dance have to do with anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Venom (2018) did not have high expectations but won big at the box office. Production budget was $116 million, winning big at the box office with $856 million. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) only cost $110 million to produce and premiered during the Covid-19 pandemic, continuing to gross more than $506 million.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/95e3ddf2-8fc6-4fd0-ab82-5b6e008b2fcf\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>This anti-hero brand was not highly appreciated by critics, but the audience loved it very much. The public enjoyed the martial arts battles between Eddie Brock and the Symbiote. Through the first trailer, we can rest assured that Venom: The Last Dance still knows how to promote its strengths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, the work will not fall into the path of tragic failure called Morbius and Madame Web.</p>")

The film successfully introduced the young version of the X-Men with an extremely attractive plot. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy successfully have a certain place, not being crushed by the shadow of the two giants Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in two iconic roles - Magneto and Professor X.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/245;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/4f673fff-7c26-43ce-a1ea-96e40bb81a5e\" width=\"600\" height=\"245\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/261;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/50af95c1-0ff0-441b-ab8d-1c60b2defc00\" width=\"600\" height=\"261\"></figure><p>In X-Men First Class, Erik and Charles once invited Wolverine to join the group. However, the Weasel coldly refused. In addition, the X-Men couple also has a classic scene when Erik asks Charles to point a gun at him. Fassbender's iconic “shark smile” meme comes from this scene. These two passages are both gratefully acknowledged by Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:638/638;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/81f9563d-ca3a-44e5-8d7b-8c14e361e2f1\" width=\"638\" height=\"638\"></figure><p>Born on October 12, 1968, Hugh Jackman is in his 60s. In recent years, he has declined quite a bit due to his struggle against cancer. However, the public will be surprised when Hugh Jackman in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine looks very young, not much different from when he participated in X-Men: Day Of Future Past (2014). Surely, the Australian star trained hard for this comeback.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I'm about to lose everything I love!”</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After entering TVA on duty, Wade Wilson / Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) must ask Logan for help to save the universe he lives in.

Why does Uncle Sam's work about a Gotham City clown called New York use the language of the Rooster?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, Joker and Joaquin Phoenix were a \"sweeping\" storm from the global box office to both professional and audience awards. The younger brother of the late star River Phoenix and the tyrant Commodus in Gladiator collected all the Oscars for Best Actor, the Golden Globe for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor... \"Joker\" Joaquin Phoenix is \u200B\u200Bcompletely unmatched. Contrast with previous illustrious versions such as Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Arthur Fleck belongs to Joaquin Phoenix, separately and uniquely!</p><p>Having been given the green light right from the moment it won more than billions of dollars from global cinemas, it was not until this year that Warner Bros. and DC Comics just released a new movie. Todd Phillips confirmed that the film script was basically completed in July 2022 by posting a photo of Joaquin Phoenix reading the manuscript. Joker: Folie à Deux is a very elaborate and meticulous preparation. Joker co-screenwriter – Scott Silver returns. This is also the first time Joaquinn Phoenix participates in a movie sequel.</p><p>The opening scene of the trailer confirms that Joker: Crazy with Couples will take place in time adjacent to Joker (2019) - ending with Arthur Fleck being thrown into Arkham mental hospital.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/349fbbb6-4410-4624-a6e0-aa261a913877\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Many rumors say that Joker: Folie a Deux belongs to the musical genre, using up to 16 songs. The genre section has been updated on IMDb, but the truth remains to be seen until the movie's release date. Currently, it is only certain that the film continues to be rated R.</p><p>Anyway, music is certainly extremely important in Joker: Folie à Deux. The film indirectly confirms through the dialogue: “We use music to improve ourselves. To balance the broken parts inside us.”</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/277;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/135b9c99-6e95-472d-88b2-3218118ae637\" width=\"600\" height=\"277\"></figure><p>This time, alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga appears as Harley Quinn.</p><p>Coming from a singer background, Lady Gaga's acting in A Star Is Born or House Of Gucci both made the public gasp. A series of Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress (2019 &amp; 2022), BAFTA nominations for Best Actress (2019 &amp; 2022), Oscar nominations for Best Actress (2019)... enough to make anyone concerned about her. everyone must be silent.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/308;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/27584d97-1955-47ed-8f04-f76e8b283c1c\" width=\"600\" height=\"308\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/295;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/8cd2c539-c7ea-4027-9034-c772ba7bd4d2\" width=\"600\" height=\"295\"></figure><p>The Joker: Folie a Deux trailer proves that Todd Phillips got it right. Taking on a difficult role next to one of Hollywood's acting icons, Lady Gaga is no less competitive. It is known that to play the role of Joker's lover, Lady Gaga actively studied with co-star Joaquin Phoenix. She thoroughly applied the method acting style that is associated with Mr. Phuong's name. Gaga asked the cast and crew to call her “Lee” throughout filming. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher also emphasized: “I have never actually met Lady Gaga on set. I don't even know her!”</p><p>Harley Quinn 2024 will certainly have quite a few changes compared to the original character - the psychologist. She treated the Joker but was manipulated by the clown. Harley helps Joker escape from prison and becomes his lover. In Joker: Folie à Deux, Harley is also a patient/prisoner in Arkham. It is possible that she used to be a psychiatrist. However, in the trailer, patient Harley follows Arthur Fleck like a follower. She admires Joker: “I am nobody. I have never done anything like you in my life.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harley and Arthur</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/22aa7ae0-293a-484b-9e85-feaf172ae226\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>The first time Arthur saw Harley was at a therapy session.

Arthur and Harley dance from the stage and then move to the streets of Gotham. In addition, the classic scene of Joker jumping on the stairs is included in Joker: Folie à Deux. This time, the clown had Harley with him on the steps in front of the courthouse.</p><p><strong>Arthur also seemed to like Harley, he said: \"I'm not alone anymore.\"</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/302;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/43f7b5e9-da1f-401e-90bb-30cb27b08ddc\" width=\"600\" height=\"302\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/55ffc82c-8900-4972-bc12-d7eddd9b813e\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>Many Harley Quinn moments remind of Arthur Fleck during Joker (2019). The most obvious is the way she curls her finger into a gun shape and pulls the trigger or the scene of dancing together on the stairs. Finally - she completely \"covered\" the ending scene - using blood to paint a violent red smile!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/4e84217b-bb3a-48f2-8a67-6deba9591e1c\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>“I want to see the real you.”</p><p>When Harley said that, Arthur gradually showed his \"trademark\" smile. The ending scene couldn't be more epic for the Joker: Crazy Couple trailer. Millions of moviegoers must be very excited to go to theaters!</p><p>Of course, all of the above scenes (and Harley Quinn) could also just be in Arthur Fleck's wild imagination!</p><p>New movie Joker: Folie à Deux is expected to be released in cinemas worldwide from October 4, 2024! Don't forget to experience the super sharp IMAX Laser format at Galaxy Sala!</p>")

The theatrical film is not only expected to \"heal\" the MCU but also help re-energize and even reset Marvel's superhero universe.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/17fe8321-cea3-40da-a8cf-9e698f4652b5\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Deadpool will encounter TVA in this return, the audience will also see Deadpool and Wolverine in one frame.

Alien: Romulus / Space Monster: Romulus (08.16)</strong></p><p>The Alien brand is certainly no longer unfamiliar to the mass audience.

In 2012, Ridley Scott rebooted the new film series with Prometheus and then Alien: Covenant (2017).

Along with Kraven the Hunter and Rhino, Spider-Man's other arch-enemies Venom (Tom Hardy), Morbius (Jared Leto) and Vulture (Michael Keaton) have appeared on the big screen and will likely merge together. The final factor is El Muerto (Bad Bunny) to become the Sinister Six team to confront Spider-Man of universe 616 (\"Child Spider\" Tom Holland of the Marvel Cinematic Universe).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/10d9f43d-dd88-4605-b898-1f8ce49e64bf\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p><strong>9. Venom 3 (November 8)</strong><br>After writing the script for the first two Venom films, Kelly Marcel signed a new contract with Sony, taking on the role of writer and director for Venom 3. Many sources say that part 3 of Venom is also a \"chapter 1\". \"final\" for this alien franchise. In addition to Tom Hardy still playing the main character Venom, the new film also features other talented actors such as Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, Amy Pascal and Hutch Parker.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/8eac0dcb-e787-40b5-b2a7-d5ea2771e89b\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>In the ending of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, the main character is transported to another universe while fleeing from the punishment of the law. However, mid-credits Spider-Man: No Way Home shows that Venom has returned to his home universe. Therefore, what happens to Tom Hardy's character is still a big question mark and makes the audience curious. Venom 3 will surely answer all of the above questions. In addition, the movie will be shown in IMAX, Venom's action scenes will definitely be eye-catching.<br><strong>10. Gladiator 2 (November 22)</strong></p><p>Gladiator 2 is an action film that follows the first part released in 2000. The sequel is still directed by Ridley Scott, featuring Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen. Gladiator was one of the highest-grossing theatrical films of its release year, winning the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Best Actor award for Russell Crowe.

                            .description("<p>In 2023, the Detective Conan brand achieved many great achievements. The 26th theatrical film - Detective Conan: Black Iron Submarine surpassed the revenue mark of 10 billion yen in the Japanese market and closed at 13.88 billion yen. In Vietnam, Black Iron Submarines also reached more than 90 billion VND. For the first time, it reached the top 10 highest-grossing movies in our country. Having just celebrated its 30th anniversary not long ago, the reputation of Detective Conan is hotter than ever.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/605937d3-fcef-49cc-b6db-c63fb5f72e86\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>That's why the 27th movie - The Million Dollar Signpost is more anticipated than ever. Especially when a new movie appears from one of the most popular faces in the series: Kaitou KID.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/e3c9d494-036c-402e-86a3-9fa176b0a00e\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>In Million Dollar Five-Pointed Star, Kuroba Kaito reunites with his rival Kudo Shinichi / Edogawa Conan and encounters \"Western detective\" Hattori Heiji. When KID pretended to be Kazuha - Heiji's childhood friend, the two almost kissed if it wasn't for Conan and Ran appearing to \"interrupt\". This time, it seems, the Osaka area detective is determined to collect \"fraudulent\" debt.<br>This is the first time KID reunites with the big screen audience after Detective Conan Movie 23: The Fist of Blue Sapphire (2019). As for Heiji, he has been a \"submariner\" since Detective Conan Movie 21: Crimson Love Letter (2017) and is now appearing in a movie. Both are important characters, but KID and Heiji rarely appear together. The last time the two appeared together in a movie was Detective Conan 14: The Lost Ship In The Sky (2010).<br>More specifically, The Million Dollar Signpost will be the first time Nakamori Aoko - Kuroba Kaito's childhood friend and female lead Magic Kaito - debuts on the big screen. Born in 1987, Magic Kaito has only published 5 volumes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/f97f2068-490d-47d3-9f7d-a8897038f33e\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Not only that, Million Dollar Five-Pointed Star also added Okita Soshi from the Yaiba series with the same father Aoyama Gosho. Okita secretly loves Moroha - the main character Yaiba's younger sister. Yaiba is a successful work on the topic of swordsmanship, created between 1988 and 1993. Similar to Magic Kaito, some Yaiba characters have appeared in Detective Conan.<br>Recently, The Million Dollar Signpost released the first trailer and poster, sparking a lot of speculation.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/7218f9bd-cf19-437c-b2a4-a620fbf0cdd6\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/a9320e44-ab76-4a1f-b2a3-a4dc02731c32\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/70c943ce-30d9-4eb7-80a2-ba8c364767e0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>At first glance, it seems that this must be a difficult part of the movie for KID. From the scene of KID suffering standing in the rain, the scene of Inspector Nakamori - Aoko's father being shot and the competition scene between KID and Heiji - who are kendo masters, all predict the super thief's \"deal\" miserably, not least when \" The strongest person in the world Conan” Kyogoku Makoto smashes the shit out of The Fist of Blue Sapphire. In the trailer, Conan appears with a familiar thunder kick. This time, will you save KID as the 23rd movie?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/978231f1-eafa-4086-8f6c-e61e367234c9\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>In another part, Heiji slashes KID's hat and is stunned. The secret of Kudo Shinichi and Kuroba Kaito's similarity discovered? Author Aoyama Gosho announced that the 27th theatrical film reveals a secret never before seen in the manga. Although the details in the movie are not included in the original story, he has inserted important details in the film several times.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/61b61333-47ac-4320-94e7-bee8b8d722f0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>The biggest example is Ooka Momiji - the young lady who is trying every way to seduce Hattori Heiji. The tycoon lady made her debut in the 21st theatrical film - The Crimson Love Letter. When Black Organization casino boss Karasuma Renya was revealed, many hidden details from the Ooka family were also related to this boss. It is not excluded that the 27th theatrical film will reveal some details about Karasuma because the original story is gradually coming to an end.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/849;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/027fa149-c4a5-46f1-9d78-5f7cf8da9d1e\" width=\"600\" height=\"849\"></figure><p>On the newly released poster, the public also sees Iori Muga - a loyal butler who is rumored to be a member of the Black Organization or a secret agent. This super cool curly haired guy, the lady, Okita, and Inspector Nakamori all appear in the poster. Unfortunately, Aoko was absent. Did The Million Dollar Signpost crew want to hide Aoko to create a surprise or did Kaitou's best friend appear just for fun? In addition, the Detective Conan manga has just announced a temporary hiatus to allow the author to continue writing Magic Kaito after a super long hiatus. Is the upcoming story related to the 27th theatrical film?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/e846c8d5-e0ad-4f86-a10e-a0e84b88afd2\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Finally, the question that most loyal fans are curious about is whether in the movie where I play the main character - Hattori Heiji, will he be able to find a suitable location and successfully confess his love?<br>We have to see Mr. Gosho's opinion!</p>")

                            .description("<p>Deadpool 3 – Deadpool &amp; Wolverine has just released a trailer that has delighted global fans. It must be emphasized that, at this time, the Marvel cinematic universe is going downhill. The next movie is more criticized than the previous one. Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, Thor: Love And Thunder and The Marvels continuously made fans lose trust. However, just one trailer for the new movie Deadpool is enough to light the fire of hope in their hearts that the MCU will return to its glory days.<br>Besides the quality presence of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, what power does Deadpool &amp; Wolverine contain to create that trust? Let's take a look at the hidden meanings just revealed by Marvel!<br><strong>Wade Wilson's birthday party</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/266;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/1372f2dc-8696-4124-9bcb-460d45d0f561\" width=\"600\" height=\"266\"></figure><p>The trailer opens with a cozy birthday party attended by Blind Al, Buck, Colossus, Peter, Vanessa, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Yukio and Dopinder. This is a very happy and cheerful scene except that it is not clear whether this is really the Deadpool we saw from the previous parts or not.<br>More importantly, Shatterstar is dead!<br>In part 2, he was cut into a thousand pieces by a helicopter wing while parachuting with X-Force. Anyway, the previous Shatterstar with long hair covering his face and the cool short-haired Shatterstar now are not necessarily the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toupee</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/51df8057-7765-46aa-bee8-df35e4564f99\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>Deadpool has worn a wig several times, but this is the first time Wade Wilson has worn a wig.</p><p><strong>Deadpool and the number 17</strong></p><p>Deadpool lives on the 17th floor of the apartment building. In the way Marvel Studio often implies, the public can somewhat speculate on the plot for the upcoming new movie.</p><p>Deadpool #17 (1997): Deadpool explores strange, teleporting worlds.</p><p>Cable &amp; Deadpool #17 (2005): Part of the House Of M story arc. Deadpool discovers that Cable is alive and has a child.</p><p>Which situation is most expected to happen? I'm sure that most fans of the Marvel cinematic universe have the same answer: X-Men!</p><p><strong>TVA appeared and gathered them all into one place</strong></p><p>If you're lazy to watch the Loki series on Disney+, don't skip this summary. When the Avengers returned to the time Loki attacked Earth, Loki took the Tesseract and ran away, becoming Loki - another timeline. In the Loki series, he was captured by TVA (Time Variance Authority) and brought back to the organization. He became an employee, traveling throughout the time stream to make repairs. In Loki 2, the trickster god sacrificed himself to save the timelines, becoming the god of time of the multiverse.</p><p>Deadpool was also \"invited\" to TVA. It is unclear whether this TVA and the TVA that Loki met are the same. Because, although the costumes are similar, the logos of both sides are somewhat different. Connecting the Fox Marvel universe to the Marvel cinematic universe will cause many big changes. No matter how great Kevin Fergie's genius brain is, it is difficult to arrange two universes completely smoothly and logically.</p><p><strong>For the first time, Disney is mentioned in a Marvel movie</strong></p><p>When TVA arrived and raised his weapon, Wade Wilson responded: \"I'm used to these adult toys, but this is a Disney movie!\".</p><p>After more than a decade of dominating the global box office, even preschoolers know that Marvel belongs to Disney, but this is the first time the Mouse family has appeared on the air. Remember, when Disney bought Fox, many Deadpool fans were very worried because they were afraid that when Wade Wilson returned to the familiar children's brand, he would no longer be as \"playful\" or \"bloody\" as before.</p><p>Fortunately, through the trailer, the public can rest assured that no matter what house Wade is in, he is still Wade. That talkative guy doesn't make him obedient just because he changed houses! That is the unique quality that creates the Deadpool brand. Believe me, Disney and Marvel know what the audience wants. They won't be foolish enough to test their patience with Wade Wilson any longer. Especially after the consecutive falls from the box office and professional commentary of Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania or The Marvels.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/560;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/37f8f5bd-52de-4b71-8eef-f30ff8d3ed1d\" width=\"600\" height=\"560\"></figure><p>Wade Wilson has always been a big fan of Steve Rogers. So it was no surprise that he took a saluting stance when he saw TVA's image of Steve flashed on the screen.</p><p><strong>Will Professor X appear?</strong></p><p>After being \"snubbed\" by Scarlet Witch in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, Professor most X-Men movies and Wolverine movies. Of course, the expected version is Patrick Stewart's best Professor X. Sorry, James McAvoy.</p><p><strong>Where Logan died</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/54639828-1d9a-49ae-a914-46f01e850295\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>In the scene where Deadpool kills the TVA employee, a large tree falls behind him. In Logan, when the Weasel Man was dying, it also happened in a similar context. The difference is that when Wolverine dies, the place is not covered with snow like the scene in Deadpool 3.</p><p>However, with the tradition of using CGI to deceive viewers for generations, this difference is not surprising.</p>")

                            .description("<p>The images of IMAX theaters always delight viewers because of the realism they bring, especially with IMAX Laser. Let's join Galaxy Cinema to learn more about IMAX movie frames, where size is considered the most important. At the same</p><p>&nbsp;time, we will highlight the film genres that make the most of the potential that IMAX technology brings.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/22fd5ede-081b-42e5-ab98-875ba62ae469\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>Technically, IMAX movies will be at least 10 times clearer than old 35mm projectors. The resolution per frame is also superior by about 18,000 pixels for a 1920 pixel HD screen. The superiority can be seen in each frame and the sharpness created will be very suitable for movies that favor technical elements.<br>According to Christopher Nolan “15 perforation IMAX 70mm is the highest quality picture format ever invented”. 15 per IMAX 70mm can mean a frame that is ~70mm tall and has 15 holes above and below each frame.<br>15 per IMAX 70mm with 1.43:1 aspect ratio is considered to provide the best IMAX experience. But not every cinema can own a screen enough to display the full quality of 15 per IMAX 70mm. Currently, Galaxy Sala owns IMAX Laser 4K, the frame has IMAX scenes cut into 1.90:1, which is the best IMAX movie choice in Vietnam.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/27b0d915-fc47-4bc8-a154-d0063a049d44\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p>IMAX movies are considered by many people to be 3D movies that do not require glasses. Going back in time to 2009, director James Cameron stunned the world with Avatar - the world's first 3D movie. In Avatar, the planet Pandora is as beautiful as a dream, where everything appears before the viewer's eyes realistically and extremely vividly.</p><p>Along with the development of science and technology, the cinema industry has also brought IMAX movies, with excellent quality and outstanding realism. Accordingly, action, adventure, fantasy and science fiction films will be realized through IMAX films. The above film genres will be able to make full use of IMAX's technological potential, thereby bringing the audience a perfect visual feast.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d3a8e972-9ae9-4818-8caf-2aed729ffce9\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p>The big screen is always the choice of audiences when they want to enjoy fantasy or action movies. And with movies shot in IMAX, action sequences or scenes will expand to cover the entire screen, allowing viewers to see about 40% more images than usual with sharpness. The frame rate is also significantly increased, helping to maximize the \"smoothness\" of details and images.</p><p><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The film directed by Christopher Nolan tells the story of the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. A good movie would be perfect to watch at an IMAX theater. Especially the Trinity test scene, with IMAX format, viewers will truly feel the scale of the explosion like the scientists there.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/295d20da-b4c1-4749-9ed3-8f9f62f62dbd\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p><strong>Dune: Sand Planet</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dune: Sand Planet is certainly no longer strange to the mass audience. In addition to the captivating story and Timotheé Chalamet's top acting talent, Dune's image quality is also highly appreciated by audiences and critics. When viewed in an IMAX theater, the world of Arrakis is painted incredibly realistically. Viewers can almost feel the dryness and burn of a sand-covered planet, interwoven with the vast, majestic landscapes that the world of Dune brings.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/dc04c42a-ae10-43c4-9d69-edf56d5dbdcb\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p><strong>Avatar: Water Flow</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it's over 3 hours long, the world that James Cameron brings is truly of such quality that viewers really don't want to take their eyes off the screen. The film is truly overwhelming with a world filled with color, an ocean with clear blue water. In contrast to Dune, Avatar: Flow of Water brings a cool, soothing world, an unforgettable experience at IMAX theaters.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/d38487b5-8f67-4b8d-a64e-3ad2d6603dc1\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure><p><strong>Tenets</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although the plot is difficult to understand, sometimes you have to watch it many times to fully understand Christopher Nolan's intentions, however, Tenet is an experience that is hard to miss with IMAX. The film's action scenes are extremely elaborately designed and choreographed. The character's perspective is also intentionally refined to bring the most realistic moments of cinematic enjoyment.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/1b926a4d-8b20-41d2-98bb-846c9d8a160f\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p><strong>The Lion King</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The live action of one of the most famous movies of the Mouse family, although not very popular with fans of the original, received positive reactions from audiences watching at IMAX theaters. The animals are surprisingly lifelike. Especially the scene of Mufasa's death is described realistically in every detail. The audience seems to be transformed into Simba's fear and panic when witnessing the stampede.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/338;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/2867895d-a94b-4a9b-a599-c54374208b4d\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><p><strong>Interstellar</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who favors using IMAX, most of his works are shot with IMAX cameras. Interstellar is a project that can be considered a classic with a unique idea about black holes in the universe - a mystery that has not yet been solved by scientists. The vast universe is presented before the viewer's eyes as if the viewer is wearing a protective suit and admiring the perfect beauty.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:600/400;\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/diuvxe6q3/image/upload/v1/blog/2e6ceedb-d261-4904-9294-7eea4b133d14\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></figure>")
